    "This demonstration will extract delay parameters from the articles in `filepath_list` using the prompts in the `prompts` directory. A dictionary of `prompt_filepaths` is used to loop through each prompt and each output is saved in the `outputs` dictionary. The `outputs` dictionary contains the messages from GPT as message.content objects so this needs to be parsed into a `parsed_outputs` dictionary, which contains strings. This is then saved as a JSON object `outputs.json`. A demonstration of`outputs.json` can be found in the examples directory, if you don't have the API key."

The disease, characterized by severe symptoms including high fever, rash, hemorrhagic tendencies, and central nervous system involvement, resulted in 31 infections and 7 deaths. The incubation period ranged from 3 to 9 days, and the disease manifested with severe symptoms leading to death in some cases. The virus was identified as an RNA virus and was isolated from various bodily fluids.

The study involved identifying cases based on a specific case definition and confirming them through various laboratory tests. A total of 154 cases were identified, with a case fatality rate of 83%. The outbreak was primarily among young male miners, with evidence suggesting multiple introductions of the virus into the population. The cessation of the outbreak coincided with the flooding of the mine, supporting the hypothesis that the virus reservoir might inhabit caves or mines.

The outbreak was primarily concentrated in a gold-mining village called Durba. The study involved identifying cases based on a specific case definition and confirming them through various laboratory tests. The results showed that the outbreak involved multiple genetic lineages of the Marburg virus, suggesting multiple introductions of the virus into the human population. The outbreak was characterized by a high case fatality rate and primarily affected young male miners. The cessation of the outbreak coincided with the flooding of the mine, which was suspected to be a significant site of virus transmission.\n",

The primary case involved a young Australian man who had traveled through Rhodesia and subsequently died in Johannesburg Hospital. Two secondary cases occurred: one in his traveling companion and another in a nurse who cared for him. The article details the clinical presentation, management, and virological studies of the three patients, comparing these findings with the previous outbreak. It also discusses the epidemiological and clinical aspects of the disease, including the incubation period, symptoms, and outcomes.\n",

Martini, published in the Postgraduate Medical Journal in August 1973, details an outbreak of Marburg virus disease that occurred in 1967 among individuals in Germany and Yugoslavia who were exposed to infected African green monkeys imported from Uganda. The disease, characterized by severe symptoms including high fever, rash, hemorrhagic tendencies, and central nervous system involvement, resulted in 31 infections and 7 deaths. The incubation period ranged from 3 to 9 days, and the disease manifested with severe symptoms leading to death in some cases. The virus was identified as an RNA virus and was isolated from various bodily fluids. The article also discusses the clinical management, pathology, diagnosis, and epidemiology of the disease, noting the transmission routes and the challenges in treatment.\n",

      "The article discusses an outbreak of Marburg Hemorrhagic Fever (MHF) that occurred in a gold-mining village in the northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo from October 1998 to September 2000. The outbreak involved multiple genetic lineages of the Marburg virus, indicating ongoing introduction of the virus into the population. The study involved identifying cases based on a specific case definition and confirming them through various laboratory tests. A total of 154 cases were identified, with a case fatality rate of 83%. The outbreak was primarily among young male miners, with evidence suggesting multiple introductions of the virus into the population. The cessation of the outbreak coincided with the flooding of the mine, supporting the hypothesis that the virus reservoir might inhabit caves or mines. The article also discusses the clinical presentation, epidemiology, and potential reservoirs of the Marburg virus.\n",

      "**Summary of the Article:**\n",
      "The article describes an outbreak of Marburg virus disease in Johannesburg in 1975, following a previous outbreak in 1967 in West Germany and Yugoslavia. The primary case involved a young Australian man who had traveled through Rhodesia and subsequently died in Johannesburg Hospital. Two secondary cases occurred: one in his traveling companion and another in a nurse who cared for him. The article details the clinical presentation, management, and virological studies of the three patients, comparing these findings with the previous outbreak. It also discusses the epidemiological and clinical aspects of the disease, including the incubation period, symptoms, and outcomes.\n",

      "1. **Incubation Period:**\n",
      "   - The article mentions that the incubation period in the 1967 outbreak was estimated to be three to nine days. For the 1975 outbreak, it suggests that the first patient likely contracted the disease during his travels in Rhodesia, and the third case (a nurse) had an incubation period of about seven or eight days.\n",
