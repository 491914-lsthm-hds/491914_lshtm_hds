Abstract
Marburg virus (family Filoviridae) causes sporadic outbreaks of severe hemorrhagic disease in sub-Saharan Africa. Bats have
been implicated as likely natural reservoir hosts based most recently on an investigation of cases among miners infected in
2007 at the Kitaka mine, Uganda, which contained a large population of Marburg virus-infected Rousettus aegyptiacus fruit
bats. Described here is an ecologic investigation of Python Cave, Uganda, where an American and a Dutch tourist acquired
Marburg virus infection in December 2007 and July 2008. More than 40,000 R. aegyptiacus were found in the cave and were
the sole bat species present. Between August 2008 and November 2009, 1,622 bats were captured and tested for Marburg
virus. Q-RT-PCR analysis of bat liver/spleen tissues indicated ,2.5% of the bats were actively infected, seven of which
yielded Marburg virus isolates. Moreover, Q-RT-PCR-positive lung, kidney, colon and reproductive tissues were found,
consistent with potential for oral, urine, fecal or sexual transmission. The combined data for R. aegyptiacus tested from
Python Cave and Kitaka mine indicate low level horizontal transmission throughout the year. However, Q-RT-PCR data show
distinct pulses of virus infection in older juvenile bats (,six months of age) that temporarily coincide with the peak twice-
yearly birthing seasons. Retrospective analysis of historical human infections suspected to have been the result of discrete
spillover events directly from nature found 83% (54/65) events occurred during these seasonal pulses in virus circulation,
perhaps demonstrating periods of increased risk of human infection. The discovery of two tags at Python Cave from bats
marked at Kitaka mine, together with the close genetic linkages evident between viruses detected in geographically distant
locations, are consistent with R. aegyptiacus bats existing as a large meta-population with associated virus circulation over
broad geographic ranges. These findings provide a basis for developing Marburg hemorrhagic fever risk reduction
strategies.

Introduction
Marburg virus (family Filoviridae), is the etiologic agent of
Marburg hemorrhagic fever (MHF), a severe disease associated
with person-to-person transmission and high case fatality. The
virus was discovered in August 1967 when simultaneous outbreaks
of MHF occurred in laboratory workers in Germany and
Yugoslavia [1,2]. The source of the virus was associated with
importation of infected African green monkeys (Cercopithecidae:
formerly Cercopithecus aethiops; currently Chlorocebus tantalus [3])
consigned from Uganda to Europe for use in the laboratories
where the outbreaks occurred [4].
Since its discovery, the sporadic nature of Marburg virus
outbreaks and the diverse history of human exposures have made
it difficult to definitively trace the virus to its natural source, but
mounting evidence has shown a recurrent link to caves or mines,

leading investigators to suspect bats as a likely reservoir. In early
February 1975, the second known outbreak of MHF occurred
after two tourists traveled through Zimbabwe and reported
sleeping in rooms with bats and visiting Chinhoyi caves in the
days before developing symptoms [5]. In January 1980, and then
again in August 1987, two patients contracted MHF after visiting a
cave complex with large bat populations on Mt Elgon, Kenya.
From
1998–2000,
a
protracted
outbreak
occurred
at
the
Goroumbwa mine in Durba village in northeast Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) and consisted of multiple short chains
of virus transmission among gold miners and their families [6]. A
concomitant ecological investigation found the mine to be
populated with large numbers of bats of several species, three of
which were later found to have evidence of Marburg virus
infection, most notably the Egyptian fruit bat Rousettus aegyptiacus
(order Chiroptera: family Pteropodidae) which had the highest
prevalence (20.5%) of antibody to the virus [7]. In 2005, a
healthcare center-based outbreak in Uige, northern Angola,
became the first MHF outbreak to be detected on the west coast
of Africa and the largest MHF outbreak on record [8]. The origin
of the Angola outbreak was never determined, but that same year
in nearby Gabon, a survey of 1,100 bats representing 10 bat
species found only the cave-dwelling R. aegyptiacus to be positive for
evidence of Marburg virus infection [9]. However, in both the
Gabon and Durba DRC studies, scientists were unable to isolate
Marburg virus from infected bat tissues.
In July and September 2007, MHF re-emerged in gold miners,
this time in southwest Uganda at the Kitaka mine which is
approximately 1,280 km from Durba. Here, genetic evidence
showed two independent virus introductions from the natural
reservoir into humans. A mark-recapture study estimated the mine
to populated by over 100,000 R. aegyptiacus, from which five
genetically diverse Marburg virus isolates were obtained from bats
collected over an eight month period, demonstrating that R.
aegyptiacus can naturally harbor infectious Marburg virus and that
multiple lineages of virus can persist in a same bat colony for an
extended period [10].
A year later, in late June 2008, MHF again occurred in
southwest Uganda. This case involved a Dutch tourist who
became fatally infected following a visit to Python Cave in Queen
Elizabeth National Park (QENP) [11]. Python Cave is a popular
tourist attraction 50 linear kilometers from the Kitaka mine and is
known for the large African rock pythons that give the cave its
name, but more importantly, its large R. aegyptiacus colony upon
which the snakes feed. The publicity from the Dutch MHF case
resulted in the retrospective identification of a second, non-lethal,
MHF case associated with Python Cave. This individual was an
American tourist who visited the bat colony in late December
2007 and developed MHF symptoms soon after returning home to
Colorado, USA [12].
Together, these epidemiologic and laboratory data indicate R.
aegyptiacus is a natural reservoir for Marburg virus. However,
important questions remain such as how the virus naturally persists
in these bats, and what ecological drivers cause occasional spillover
from bats to humans. In the present study, we report a multi-year
investigation of natural Marburg virus circulation among R.
aegyptiacus in southwest Uganda, with emphasis on bats inhabiting
Python Cave. Our data show a dynamic pattern of Marburg virus
transmission that produces cyclical fluctuations in active infections
associated with defined age cohorts of the bat population.
Results/Discussion
Description of Python Cave and bat collections
In response to the infection of the American and Dutch tourists,
a series of four ecological investigations were conducted at Python
Cave from August 2008 through November 2009. The goals of
this study were to 1) determine if Marburg virus infected bats were
present in the cave, and if so, what species of bat; and 2) determine
what ecological factors, if any, may have led to the human
infections. Rousettus aegyptiacus breed twice a year, becoming
pregnant around November and May and giving birth in February
and August, respectively (gestation period is approximately 105–
107 days based on captive observations) [13]. The bat collections
were scheduled during peak breeding or birthing periods (August
2008, February 2009, August 2009, November 2009) and were
designed to complement two previous studies at the nearby Kitaka
mine which were also carried out during similar peak times of
either the birthing or breeding seasons (August 2007 and May
2008 respectively). Based on comparisons to the Kitaka mine,
which contained over 100,000 R. aegyptiacus and a large number of
smaller insectivorous bats (Hipposiderous spp.), the bat population at
Python Cave was estimated to be at least 40,000 animals, and R.
aegyptiacus was the sole chiropteran inhabitant of the cave.
Python Cave is actually a tunnel open at both ends, and is
approximately 15 meters (m) long and 12 m wide, formed by a
subterranean stream that undercut a land bridge spanning a small
gorge. The height of the interior is variable, ranging from 3.5 m to
nearly 5 m due to the boulder strewn floor, and the cave contains
numerous nooks, crevices and hidden chambers, with nearly every
square centimeter of ‘hanging space’ used by the bats. The limited
space forces bats to occupy sunlit ledges of the gorge on either side
of the tunnel openings. Most juvenile bats were observed roosting
in these more peripherally located pockets and ledges near the
ground, both inside and outside of the tunnel proper while adults
tended to occupy the darker interior. These juvenile bats were also
observed roosting on the sides of the larger boulders and in holes
on the cave floor.
In addition to the bats, other vertebrate fauna observed in the
cave included at least two large African rock pythons (Python sebae),
and several forest cobras (Naja melanoleuca). Also observed visiting
Author Summary
Marburg virus, like its close relative Ebola virus, can cause
large outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever with case fatalities
nearing 90%. For decades the identity of the natural
reservoir was unknown. However, in 2007 Marburg viruses
were isolated directly from Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus
aegyptiacus) that inhabited a Ugandan gold mine where
miners were previously infected. Soon after, two tourists
became infected with Marburg virus after visiting nearby
Python Cave, a popular attraction in Queen Elizabeth
National Park, Uganda. This cave also contained R.
aegyptiacus bats (,40,000 animals). These events prompt-
ed a long-term investigation of Python Cave to determine
if, 1) R. aegyptiacus in the cave carried infectious Marburg
virus genetically similar to that found in the tourists, and 2)
what ecological factors might influence virus spillover to
humans. In the study, we found that, 1) approximately
2.5% of the bat colony is actively infected at any one time
and that virus isolates from bats are genetically similar to
those from infected tourists, and 2) specific age groups of
bats (juveniles,six months of age) are particularly likely to
be infected at specific times of the year that roughly
coincide with historical dates of Marburg virus spillover
into humans.

the cave were African fish eagles (Haliaeetus vocifer), palm-nut
vultures (Gypohierax angolensis), Nile monitor lizards (Varanus niloticus)
and olive baboons (Papio anubis). Further, a variety of invertebrates
were found, most notably argasid ticks (Family Argasidae) on the
cave walls, nycteribiid flies (Family Nycteribiidae) in the bat
pelage, and fresh water crabs (Crustacea: Decapoda) in the
subterranean stream beneath the cave floor.
Over the four sampling periods at Python Cave, 1,622 R.
aegyptiacus were captured and tested for Marburg virus. Both
genders were represented nearly equally (Table 1). Of the 798
females captured, 449 were of active breeding age evidenced by
having an attached pup, being pregnant or having enlarged
nipples indicative of previous lactation. Of the 824 males captured,
453 were scrotal. The majority (61%) of the total captures
(n = 1,622) were adults (n = 993; forearm length .89 mm) while
the remainder consisted of volant juveniles (n = 417) or newborn
pups (n = 212).
Evidence of Marburg virus infection by Q-RT-PCR and
virus isolation from bat tissues
Viral RNA extracted from pooled liver and spleen samples were
tested for Marburg virus RNA using a real-time Q-RT-PCR assay
designed to detect all known strains of Marburg virus [10]. Of the
1,622 bats captured, 40 (2.5%) were actively infected as evidenced
by having detectable Marburg virus RNA (Q-RT-PCR positive).
A population estimate of 40,000 bats combined with an infection
level of 2.5% estimates approximately 1,000 actively infected bats
to reside inside this popular tourist destination at certain times of
the year. Several other tissues tested positive for Marburg virus
RNA (Table 2) and always in conjunction with positive liver and
spleen samples, including kidney (n = 2), colon and rectum (n = 5),
lung (n = 8), heart (n = 3), intestine (n = 3) and blood (n = 2). The
array of virus-infected tissues indicates that R. aegyptiacus inhabiting
Python Cave are probably in diverse stages of infection. Some
bats, (e.g. bat #843 in Table 2) appear acutely and systemically
infected as evidenced by simultaneous infection of lung, liver/
spleen, kidney, colon, mid-gut, heart and blood. The Marburg
virus-specific RNA loads found in blood of bats #843 and #1175
were very low (Ct values between 30–39; indicating lower amounts
of viral RNA) and could not explain the higher RNA levels seen in
the other infected tissues (Ct values between 20–30; indicating
higher amounts of viral RNA). All bats with multiple Marburg
virus-positive tissues were also positive by testing of pooled liver/
spleen suggesting that liver and spleen remain the best target
tissues for identifying Marburg virus-infected R. aegyptiacus. Finding
Marburg virus in tissues from lung, kidney, colon, and mid-gut
raises the possibility of virus shedding through an oral, fecal, or
urinary route(s). One bat had Marburg virus-positive reproductive
tissue (uterus/ovary) which, given the previous discovery of Ebola
virus in reproductive tissue of infected humans [14–16] and active
Marburg virus transmission via semen [17], raises the possibility of
sexual transmission among bats. The potential involvement of
arthropod vectors has not been ruled out, although limited

numbers of argasid ticks (14 pools of 10–20 ticks) collected thus far
from the cave were negative for Marburg virus RNA by Q-RT-
PCR.
From the Q-RT- PCR positive bats at Python Cave, seven
genetically distinct Marburg virus isolates (Table 1) were obtained
directly from homogenized liver/spleen tissue, and for one bat
(#843) virus was additionally isolated from lung and blood
(viremia). These virus isolates, combined with those from five bats
captured at the Kitaka mine, bring to 12 the total number of bats
from which Marburg virus has been isolated. In fact, Marburg
virus was isolated at least once from each R. aegyptiacus collection
expedition in Uganda, including those at the Kitaka mine [10],
with the exception of the 2009 February/March Python Cave
collection, which yielded no virus isolate. There were no
significant differences in the ability to isolate virus from either
Q-RT-PCR positive adults (2/11, 18.18%) or juveniles (5/28,
17.85%; t = 20.023, p..98), or likewise, from males (3/19,
15.79%) or females (4/20, 20.0%; t = .334, p..70). Successful
isolation of Marburg virus roughly correlated with samples that
had Ct values of 30 or less (.2000 TCID50/ml).
Immunohistochemical analyses
Immunohistochemical analysis (IHC) was performed on forma-
lin fixed liver and spleen tissues from all Q-RT-PCR positive bats
and an approximate equal number of negative bats. Of the 40
Marburg virus positive bats, four (10%) were positive via IHC in
liver, one of which (Bat #843) was additionally positive in spleen.
All Q-RT-PCR positive heart, lung, kidney, colon and mid-gut
tissues shown in Table 2 with Ct values less than 35 (virus loads
.,100 TCID50/ml), were additionally tested by IHC, but none
were positive for Marburg virus antigen. There was no evidence of
any pathology apparent during necropsies or IHC analysis that
could be attributed directly to infection with Marburg virus.
Moreover, there were no signs of overt morbidity or mortality
witnessed during the capture or processing of the bats, including
those actively infected with Marburg virus. However, the cave
environment is such that dead or dying bats might not be visible
for long periods of time due to predation, guano accumulation,
and the large detritivore community living in the cave.
Phylogenetic relationship of Marburg virus sequences
from bats and humans and evidence of long distance R.
aegyptiacus movement
Full-length genome sequences (19,114 bp) were determined
from all seven of the Python Cave Marburg virus bat isolates. Two
isolates (164QBat Uga 2008 and 1328QBat Uga 2009) closely
match the sequence of the virus isolate obtained from the Dutch
MHF case (01Uga/Net 2008; Fig. 1) based on a Bayesian analysis.
Unfortunately, no virus was isolated from the American tourist,
but the sequence from small portions of the NP and VP35 genes
were obtained from clinical material following amplification by
nested RT-PCR. The sequences were concatenated into a single
,700 nt sequence and analyzed with corresponding Marburg
virus sequences from bats and humans using similar Bayesian
methods. As expected, multiple Marburg virus sequences from
Python Cave bats closely match that of the American tourist
(Fig. 2). Further, these two analyses produced phylogenies showing
that the entire known genetic spectrum of Marburg virus, .20%
nucleotide diversity, can be found circulating in Python Cave at
any one time. This finding is consistent with R. aegyptiacus
representing a bona fide long term reservoir species for the virus.
The fact that several of the Marburg virus sequences from
Python Cave and Kitaka mine are similar to sequences obtained
from distant regions of sub-Saharan Africa including Gabon
(48Gab 2005, 31Gab 2005, and 96Gab 2006) and Zimbabwe
(OzoZim
1975)
suggest
that
there
is
considerable
animal
movement over long distances and exchange of infectious virus
through a network of R. aegyptiacus colonies that span the
continent. As proof of direct animal movement between R.
aegyptiacus bat colonies, a numbered collar was found at Python
Cave in August 2008 that had been initially placed on an adult
female R. aegyptiacus bat at the Kitaka mine during the mark and
recapture study three months earlier [10]. The Kitaka mine and
Python Cave are separated by roughly 50 linear kilometers and
separated by tracts of dense forest and zones of agricultural
activity. In South Africa, marked R. aegyptiacus have been shown to
move up to 32 km between roosting sites and in one instance, a
marked female relocated to a site 500 km away [18]. Additional
evidence of direct movement between colonies was found when a
second R. aegyptiacus bat, marked as a male juvenile at the Kitaka
mine in 2008, was captured at the Python Cave as an adult in
August of 2009, a full 15 months after the initial capture and
marking.
Older juvenile bats are most likely to be actively infected
with Marburg virus
In the initial 2007 Kitaka mine investigation [10], a significantly
higher proportion of juvenile bats were found to be actively
infected than were adults (12% vs 4.2% respectively), yet in the
follow-up study at the same location nine months later (in May
2008), the proportions of infected juveniles and adults were slightly
inverted (1.7% vs 5.7% respectively) [10]. From these early data, it
was hypothesized that perhaps the reason for the difference in
infection prevalence resided in factors related to the age of the
juvenile cohorts, being six months old during the birthing seasons
(August and February) yet only three months old during the
breeding seasons (May and November). At the time of capture,
older juveniles (six months old) would have been weaned for at
least four months, fully independent and without any residual
Marburg-specific maternal antibody if they were born to an
antibody positive mother. In contrast juveniles caught during
breeding seasons (May and November) would be roughly three
months old, barely independent, and newly released from the
physically occlusive protection of their mother. Newborn pups
remain attached to the nipple and well under the wing of the
mother for the first six weeks of their lives and then remain in close
contact, occasionally clinging to the mother’s back for an
additional two weeks (Towner and Amman personal observations
of captive R. aegyptiacus bats).
Analysis of the Python Cave Q-RT-PCR data reveals a seasonal
age bias among Marburg virus-infected bats which correlates with
that observed at Kitaka mine [10]. Of the 40 total Q-RT-PCR
positive bats from Python Cave, 29 (of 627 total) were juveniles
compared to 11 (of 994 total) adults (t = 3.898, p,.001). When the
active infection data from the Kitaka mine and Python Cave
investigations are combined and sorted into three age categories,
young juveniles, old juveniles and adults, a reproducible age-linked
infection pattern emerges (Fig. 3a). Levels of active infection
among young juveniles remain around 2–3% (8/301, 2.65%) and
increase to 10–15% by six months of age (30/241, 12.4%;
t = 24.212, p,.001). Adults by contrast maintain a relatively
constant level of active infection (Fig. 3b) ranging from 2–5% (33/
1467, 2.4%), irrespective of season (breeding season = 11/305,
3.6%; and birthing season = 22/1163, 1.9%; t = 1.508, p..13%).
Interestingly, no evidence of vertical transmission was found. In
one instance, a Q-RT-PCR positive mother was identified with an
Q-RT-PCR negative pup. Moreover, all pups from either Kitaka

mine or Python Cave (n = 223) tested uniformly negative for active
Marburg virus infection.
Together, these data present a dynamic picture of natural
Marburg virus circulation in which juveniles are exposed to the
virus at an early stage of their development following indepen-
dence at three months of age and increasing up through their first
six months of life. Once in the adult population after seven to eight
months of age, the incidence of infection apparently drops off for
reasons not currently understood and levels out to a more constant
rate that is independent of season. We are currently developing
reliable measures for sub-adult age classification, but until they are
complete, tracking the younger age cohorts beyond six to seven
months of age remains difficult.
The overall pattern of horizontal transmission is supported by
serological data from the Python Cave bats in which Marburg
virus-specific IgG antibody prevalence increases with age starting
from 4.1% (10/242) among young juveniles and increases to
14.8% (26/175) among older juveniles and finally reaches 21.5%
(214/993) in adults. The lower infection levels observed in young
juveniles is likely due to lack of physical opportunity for exposure
to other members of the population perhaps aided by maternal
antibody protection for those pups born to antibody positive
mothers. In our analyses, all pups of antibody positive mothers
(n = 20) were themselves antibody positive. It is unknown if
maternal antibody is actually protective.
We speculate that the introduction of Marburg virus into the
juvenile bat population may also be influenced by the positioning
of bat groups within the cave. On every occasion, segregation of
juveniles (non-pups) from adults was witnessed with juvenile bats
generally pushed to the periphery of the cave away from the center
where it is darkest. At the periphery, juveniles were observed
roosting tightly together primarily in small holes or on the sides of
large boulders on the cave floor. Occasionally small groups of
juveniles could be found low on the walls but outside the cave in
filtered sunlight. The cave floor contains copious amounts of
accumulated guano (feces and urine) that are continually refreshed
by new deposits. Should virus be shed through bat excretions, the
physical positioning of juvenile bats directly underneath the adult
bats would make juvenile bats particularly susceptible to virus

and fecal samples for viral RNA has not yet yielded positive results,
probably due to persistent Q-RT-PCR inhibitors that have thus
far hindered our ability to detect Marburg virus RNA in
experimentally spiked guano samples in the laboratory (data not
shown). Nevertheless, finding of Marburg virus-positive kidney,
colon/rectum, and intestine samples, suggests virus shedding
through excreta may well occur.
As the juveniles age and are recruited into the adult population
or disperse to other caves or suitable sites, the low lying roosting
areas are repopulated by the next pulse of newly weaned juveniles.
These juveniles in-turn become infected, spreading the virus
primarily amongst themselves until they too disperse or move into
the adult population. This cycle continues season after season to
perpetuate virus transmission within the colony. The pattern of
continual circulation of the virus within the population coupled
with the continued lack of any overt morbidity and mortality in
infected bats is consistent with expectations for Rousettus aegyptiacus
being a natural reservoir for Marburg virus.
Seasonal clustering of spillover events to humans
coincide with peaks of infection in juvenile bats
The approximate dates of 13 suspected Marburg virus spillover
events were determined from the literature (Table 3), seven of
which were linked directly to subterranean gold mining activities
at the bat-inhabited mines in Durba, DRC from 1994–1997 [6]
and Ibanda, Uganda 2007 [10]. Five spillover events involved
tourists with defined dates of visitation to caves containing R.
aegyptiacus, in the weeks just before the onset of MHF symptoms.
The original 1967 outbreak was also included, and for that, a date
was chosen that was one incubation period (three weeks) prior to
the first shipment of infected monkeys that arrived in Frankfurt,
Germany on 21 July 1967 (via London Heathrow airport) and
further distributed within Germany (Marburg and Frankfurt) and
to Belgrade, Yugoslavia [19]. When all 13 Marburg virus spillover
events are listed by month of occurrence, the data show a temporal
clustering of human infections, coinciding with the summer (mid-
June through mid-September) and winter months (mid-December

through mid-March) of the northern hemisphere. The majority of
spillover events (7/13) involved resident African miners, suggesting
that the clustering effect was not due to seasonal tourism. More
importantly, when the dates of these 13 spillover events are
compared to a sinusoidal curve derived from the field collection
data showing the seasonal incidence of juvenile R. aegyptiacus
infections (Fig. 4), a pattern of coincidence emerges. The
sinusoidal curve has peaks and troughs that correspond to the
beginning of the birthing and breeding seasons respectively, each
separated by roughly three months, and whose peak heights reflect
the average percentage of infected juveniles for each seasonal
category. These data show that 11 of 13 (84.6%, Fisher’s Exact
Test p,.05) spillover events occurred during the three month
periods encompassing each of the two biannual birthing seasons
when juvenile bats are roughly 4.5–7.5 months old and most likely
to be infected with Marburg virus. Moreover, when suspected
(extrapolated) exposure dates for 52 primary cases (all miners and
epidemiologically unlinked to any other human cases; Table S1)
from the final MHF patient list from the 1998–2000 outbreak in
Durba, DRC [6] are included in the analysis (Pierre Rollin and
Robert Swanepoel; personal communication; Table S2), 54 of 65
(83.1% Fisher’s Exact Test p,.05) spillover events occur during
the same periods encompassing each of the biannual birthing
seasons, further supporting the idea that these three-month periods
may represent times of increased risk for exposure to Marburg
virus. The contribution of young naı
¨ve bats to the overall
population during these seasons is considerable. Based on a
population estimate of 40,000 bats in Python Cave and 80%
pregnancy of sexually active females [10,20], the number of births
at Python Cave could easily exceed 20,000 pups a year (10,000
pups every 6 months). Many of those pups will become juveniles
that are ultimately pushed to the periphery of the cave where they
may be more likely to encounter humans.
We conclude that Marburg virus transmission within the R.
aegyptiacus colony occurs year round at a baseline level, and that the
months surrounding the peak birthing seasons represent times of
increased infection among juveniles. Further, the coincidence of
peak periods of juvenile bat infections with the historical clustering
of individual spillover events to humans at similar times of the year
suggests these seasonal periods might represent periods of
heightened public health risk perhaps due to the positioning of
the juvenile roosting sites within the cave. These data provide the
first long-term monitoring of any filovirus circulating in nature and
provide a foundation for understanding ecological drivers that
may instigate MHF outbreaks.
Materials and Methods
Bat capture and processing
All procedures listed herein (including those referred to in
Towner et al. [10]), were performed in accordance with an
institutionally approved animal care and use protocol (animal use
protocol 1731AMMULX approved by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee). All aspects of the bat collections were undertaken
with the approval of the Uganda Wildlife Authority and following
the American Veterinary Medical Association guidelines on
euthanasia and the National Research Council recommendations
for the care and use of laboratory animals [21,22].
Without exception, protective equipment (PPE) standard for
working with filoviruses in the field setting was used [23]. Briefly,
all personnel donned double latex gloves, disposable Tyvek suit,
rubber boots, fitted p100 respirators (3M) and eye protection (in
the form of a full face shield or full-face respirator) prior to
entering the cave. When appropriate, personnel used bite-resistant
gloves, full face shields, caving helmets for head protection, and
due of the presence of multiple venomous snakes, Kevlar chaps to
prevent snake bites on the lower extremities. All personnel were
misted down with 3% Lysol immediately upon exit of the cave.
During necropsies, PPE was less cumbersome but included double
latex gloves, disposable gowns, and powered air-purifying respi-
rator (PAPR) units (3M).
To maximize the chances of isolating virus, large numbers of R.
aegyptiacus were sampled over the course of four separate
collections spanning one year and three months beginning in
August 2008. Bats were captured and processed following
procedures detailed in Towner et al. [10]. The notable exceptions
to those procedures were that harp traps were used exclusively to

capture bats and more tissue types were collected. Replicate tissue
samples were also preserved in 10% formalin for a minimum of
four days and later changed to 70% ethanol for long term storage.
Bats were identified morphometrically [24] and their measure-
ments, sex, and breeding status were recorded
Collection of additional fauna
Adult and nymphal argasid ticks (14 pools of 10–20) were
collected from crevices in the rocks near bat roosting sites and
immediately placed in chaotropic RNA extraction buffer. Collec-
tions of endoparasites occurred during necropsies and were
identified as tongue worms of the phylum Pentastomida. These
parasites were typically found on the liver and spleen.
Virus isolation
Virus isolation attempts were carried out as described in
Towner et al. [10]. Briefly, approximate 250 mg frozen tissue
sections were placed on ice and homogenized in viral transport
medium (HBSS/5% fetal calf serum) using sterile alundum (Fisher
cat# A634-3) to form 10% suspensions. The homogenate was
then spun at low speed for 5–10 minutes a 4uC and 100 ul of
resulting supernatant was used to inoculate Vero E6 cells in
25 cm2 flasks at 37uC/5% CO2 for 1 hr. Media was then replaced
with MEM/2% fetal calf serum and monitored for 14 days with a
media change on day 7. All cultures were then tested by IFA for
Marburg virus.
Q-RT-PCR, RT-PCR and nucleotide sequencing analysis
Q-RT-PCR, RT-PCR, and nucleotide sequencing, were all
performed using reagents and procedures described in Towner et
al. [10]. Briefly, virus inactivation in tissue samples was achieved
by incubating approximate 100 mg of tissue samples from bats in
450 ml of 2X cellular cold lysis buffer (ABI) at 4uC for greater than
eight hours. Each tissue was then diluted to 1X and homogenized
for 2 minutes, at 1500 strokes/min using a ball-mill tissue grinder
(Genogrinder 2000, Spex Centriprep). Total RNA was extracted
from 150 ul of the homogenate [25] and tested for Marburg virus
using slightly modified Q-RT-PCR [8] or nested RT-PCR assays.
The Q-RT-PCR assay consisted of two reporter probes, 59 Fam-
ATCCTAAACAGGC‘‘T’’TGTCTTCTCTGGGACTT-39
and
59
Fam-ATCCTGAATAAGC‘‘T’’CGTCTTCTCTGGGACT-
T-39 in addition to the amplification primers (forward) 59-
GGACCACTGCTGGCCATATC-39 and (reverse) 59-GAGAA-
CATITCGGCAGGAAG-39. The quencher BHQ1 was placed
internally in the probes at the ‘‘T’’ locations. The nested VP35
RT-PCR assay is previously described [6], and consisted of
primers

and R2 (reverse-inside) 59- TCAGATGAATAIACACAI AC-

conditions were 50uC for the first round (both assays) and 54uC
(NP assay) or 50uC (VP35 assay) for the second round using high-
fidelity one-step RT-PCR reagents (Invitrogen). Primer concen-
trations and amplification conditions used were as described by the
manufacturer. Sequencing was performed using the appropriate
amplification primers and standard di-deoxy sequencing methods.
Serology
Briefly, IgG detection was performed essentially as described in
[26] with the exception that 96-well plates were coated with
200 ng/well
of purified
Marburg
(Musoke) GP (Integrated
BioTherapeutics, Gaithersburg, MD) or 200 ng/well of purified
Ebola (Zaire) GP. The purified GPs contained a deletion of the
trans-membrane domain (dTM) and were diluted in PBS. Bat sera
were diluted 1:100 and four-fold through 1:6400 in 5% non-fat
milk in PBS with 0.1% (vol/vol) Tween 20 (Bio-Rad Richmond,
CA) and allowed to react with the GP-coated wells. Bound IgG
was detected with goat anti-bat IgG (Bethyl cat# A140-118P)
conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Optical densities (OD) at
410 nm were recorded on a microplate spectrophotometer. The
adjusted OD at 410 nm was generated by subtracting the OD of
the well coated with Ebola-GP (dTM) from its corresponding
Marburg GP-coated well. All sera were analyzed in duplicate and
the threshold corrected ODs value for a positive Marburg IgG
antibody test was determined to be 0.72 based on the mean
corrected sum OD of the negative control group plus three
standard deviations. The negative control group consisted of 210
young juvenile R. aegyptiacus (,three months old). This age group
was chosen because they were the cohort considered least likely to
have evidence of previous Marburg infection based on data
presented here and previously [10] that suggest Marburg virus is
transmitted horizontally and not vertically between bats.
Immunohistochemical analyses
Immunohistochemical analyses was performed following tech-
niques described in [27] to determine if Marburg virus infection
caused lesions in infected bats. Sections were cut from paraffin-
embedded blocks prepared from formalin-fixed liver and spleen
samples from 40 bats found positive by Q-RT-PCR, and
examined concurrently with samples from 40 bats found negative
by Q-RT-PCR. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained sections of
the tissues were examined for lesions, and sections stained by an
immune-alkaline phosphatase technique with a polyclonal rabbit
anti-Marburg virus antiserum diluted to 1/1000.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses, Fisher’s Exact and two-sided indepen-
dent samples T tests, of the capture data were performed using
PASW 18.0 (SPSS Statistics, Rel. 18.0.0. 2009. Chicago: SPSS
Inc. an IBM Company).
Nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis
Sequencing of Marburg virus whole genomes and partial gene
sequences (NP and VP35) were performed as previously described
[8,9]. Multiple sequence alignments were generated in SeaView
[28] using the MAFFT function [29]. A Bayesian phylogenetic
analysis was conducted in MrBayes 3.2 [30] using the GTR+I+G
model of nucleotide substitution. Two simultaneous analyses, each
with four Markov chains, were run for 10,000,000 generations,
sampling every 100 generations. Convergence was examined prior
based on the average level of juvenile infected bats at peak times of encompassing birthing (February and August) and breeding (May and
November). Large gray arrows depict the twice yearly influx of newly autonomous juvenile bats born in the prior birthing season. The influx begins at
the approximate time of the juvenile’s independence from their mothers.

to termination of the analysis by ensuring that the standard
deviation of split frequencies had fallen below 0.01, thus
confirming that the length of the run was sufficient. Trees
generated before the stabilization of the likelihood scores were
discarded (burnin = 100), and the remaining trees were used to
construct a consensus tree. Nodal support was assessed by
posterior probability values ($.95 = statistical support). GenBank
