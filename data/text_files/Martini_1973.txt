Summary
In the late summer of 1967 an epidemic in thirty-one
patients in Germany and Yugoslavia of a disease trans-
mitted from African green monkeys occurred; seven
patients died. The incubation period was from 4 to 7
days. The main clinical features were headache, high
fever, diarrhoea, a very characteristic rash,
severe
bleeding tendency and involvement of the central ner-
vous system. Nearly all
organs were involved and
showed severe cell necroses. The aetiological agent
was
identified
as
an RNS-virus and
was named
Marburg virus. It was detected in the blood, urine,
throat-washing and seminal fluid.
IN August 1967 a hitherto unknown severe infectious
disease with features of haemorrhagic fever was
observed simultaneously in Germany and Yugo-
slavia which could be traced to imported monkeys
(Cercopithecus aethiops) from Uganda.
Until then only single cases of diseases trans-
mitted by monkeys were known (e.g. herpes simiae,
rabies, hepatitis). The new disease was the first to
occur as an epidemic.
Incidence
Altogether
thirty-one
persons
(twenty
males,
eleven females) contracted the disease: at Marburg
twenty-three, at Frankfurt six, and at Belgrade two
persons. Out of these thirty-one patients seven died.
The epidemic appeared in August and ended in
November 1967. Before and afterwards no more
cases were seen.
Clinical picture (Figs.
1 and 2)
The incubation period could be determined in
some patients who had only once been exposed to
the infectious material; it varied from 3 to 9 days.
The prodromal phase was very short. The disease
began rather abruptly with extreme malaise, pains
in
the
limbs,
and
severe
frontal and
temporal
headache.
Within a few hours the fever increased to 390C
without rigors and reached a maximum on the 3rd
and 4th days; the temperature fell gradually after-
wards with a second peak between the 12th and 20th
days.
Relative bradycardia occurred, especially in the
early days, whereas tachycardia was only found in
the fatal cases. Many patients complained from the
beginning about nausea and suffered from frequent,
and occasionally uncontrollable, vomiting. Watery
diarrhoea with blood or mucus occurred up to ten
times daily with symptoms and signs of severe
dehydration and acute renal failure.
All patients developed a characteristic maculo-
papular rash on the 5th to 8th days. It began on
the face and on the buttocks, then progressed to
the trunk and extremities. Most characteristic were
dark red pinhead papules round the hair follicles.
After 1 or 2 days it developed into a sharply de-
lineated maculo-papular lesion which coalesced into
a more diffuse and dark red erythema. Cutaneous
purpura was rare. The rash was in many patients
accompanied by scrotal dermatitis or erythema of
the greater labia. About the end of the second week
all patients peeled, especially on the palms and soles.
The external rash was in most cases accompanied
by an enanthem with dark red colouring of the
soft palate and tapioca-like transparent lesions.
A conjunctivitis and photophobia developed in
half of the patients. Swelling of the lymph nodes was
observed in the nuchal, cervical, and axillary regions
between the 3rd and 6th days of illness. The lymph
nodes were
soft and sensitive
to pressure. The
spleen was palpable in only one patient, the liver
was tender but not enlarged. The central nervous
system was affected in different ways. Nearly
all
patients showed a sullen, slightly aggressive, and
negativistic behaviour.
Those who
died became
restless, confused, unconscious, and died in deep
coma. Two had severe convulsions. Some patients
complained of paraesthesia and restless legs. One
patient developed a severe post-infectious myelitis

in
the
cerebrospinal
fluid
(Guillain-Barre syndrome). One
patient became
psychotic several weeks after the acute illness.
About half of the
patients exhibited marked
haemorrhagic diathesis with spontaneous bleeding
from the nose, gingiva and gastro-intestinal tract,
and haematuria. The women had genital bleeding.
At the sites of injections and needle punctures severe
bleeding occurred.
The pancreas was affected in several patients as
shown by the
increased serum amylase
values.

Nearly
all
patients had signs of severe hepato-
cellular damage with an extreme increase of the
transaminase
levels.
Neither jaundice
nor
true
hepatic failure developed. In the electrocardiogram
alterations compatible with diffuse myocarditis and
disturbances of cardiac rhythm were seen. In many
patients cardiac failure developed. Nearly
all of
the patients who died had severe kidney involvement
with acute renal failure. Those who survived had
longer periods of polyuria. The haemopoetic system
was severely damaged in nearly all patients as could
be recognized by marked leukopenia and
severe
thrombocytopenia.
Course of the disease
The illness
lasted 15-20 days. In
some
cases
there was a relapse. Five patients showed a further
increase
of
serum
transaminase
at
this
time
with
an increased temperature. The convalescent
period was very drawn out. There were disturbances
ofthe autonomic nervous system with exhaustion and
increased perspiration. Some of the patients had a
considerable loss of hair and complained of tender-
ness of the liver and alcohol intolerance. Unilateral
testicular atrophy was observed in five patients.
Some had reduced libido and potency and oligo-
spermia; the ketosteroid levels were normal. Three
women were delivered of four healthy babies with
no signs of disease.
Laboratory findings
The erythrocyte sedimentation rate rarely exceeded
the upper normal range. The haematologic changes
apart from leukopenia and thrombocytopenia were
characterised by a shift to the left in the granulo-
cytes with up to 40% stab cells, promyelo-, meta-
myelo- and myelocytes. This shift to the left was
accompanied by the appearance of so-called de-
generative granulocytes and Pelger-like cells. There
was
a marked increase of atypical lymphocytes,
plasma cells, immunoblasts and so-called pyronino-
phil blast cells, up to 15 % of the total count. Bone
marrow puncture showed an elevated number of
immature megakariocytes. All patients developed
severe thrombocytopenia with sometimes less than
10,000/mm3. At the same time the thrombin time was
prolonged, indicating consumptive coagulopathy.
In none of ten patients in whom the prothrombin
time, partial thromboplastin time and fibrinogen
were measured
did
the
alterations
and plasma
coagulation factors explain the severe haemorrhagic
diathesis.
The extreme increase of serum transaminases and
other
liver enzymes reflected the severe hepato-
cellular damage. In four of the five patients who died
the transaminases increased up to 3000-6000 U/1.
The relation between SGOT and SGPT was 7: 1.
The maximum increase was between the 7th and
8th days, with a second peak around the 35th day
in three patients. The bilirubin was only slightly
increased in some patients with anuria. The creatinin
and urea were elevated in those patients who died
with renal failure. The total serum protein decreased
markedly in several patients.
The
other
complications
included
broncho-
pneumonia
(five cases),
leg oedema (five cases),
orchitis (three cases), post-infectious myelitis (one
case), and psychosis (one case).
Pathology
In nearly all organs areas of focal necrosis without
much inflammatory reaction were seen. They were
particularly obvious in the liver, in the lymphatic
system, in the spleen, in the testicles and ovaries,
and in the pancreas. In addition the lymphatic
tissue showed plasmacellular, monocytoidal trans-
formation. Together with the areas of necrosis so-
called basophilic bodies were noticed near the necrotic
cells or as inclusion bodies in parenchymal cells.
Those patients who died showed glial nodule en-
cephalitis
in
all areas of the brain and serious
parenchymal damage of the kidneys with definite
signs of tubular
insufficiency and haemorrhagic
diathesis in all organs.
Diagnosis
Laboratory methods included the direct isolation
of the agent in the blood, organ tissues, throat
washings, urine and semen (Fig. 3). Virus antigen
was made visible by means of immuno-fluorescence.
Direct electron microscopic demonstration of the
virus was possible after centrifugation of serum on to
carrier films.
The morphology of the Marburg virus is most
unusual. It differs in size and shape from most known

viruses. The mean length is about 665 nm. It shares
certain similarities with other viruses (plant viruses,
Rabies, Egtred virus of rainbow trout).
A complement fixing antibody test using a cell
culture antigen from infected Vero carrier cells is
highly specific.
Epidemiology
There were four groups of infection (Fig. 4). The
first and largest group consisted of persons who had
direct contact with blood and organs of monkeys
imported from Uganda. The second group consisted
of laboratory workers who had contact with simian
organs or cell culture material. The third group con-
tracted the infection from other patients' blood.

Exposure in the household and family surroundings
remained without consequences. In one woman a
venereal way of transmission was the most probable,
since her husband was found to excrete the Marburg
virus in his semen.
The simultaneous outbreak of the disease in Mar-
burg, Frankfurt and Belgrade was traced to common
imported monkeys of the
species
Cercopithecus
aethiops from Uganda. These monkeys were flown
because of the Near East crisis, to Germany and
Yugoslavia via London, where they were kept at the
airport together with other animals. Seroepidemio-
logic studies using a complement-fixing antibody
test seemed to suggest a high percentage of positive
reactions in monkeys from Uganda and from other
areas. These results could not be confirmed by other
authors using a more specific method. The reservoir
and method of distribution of the Marburg virus are
still unknown. Intrathoracic multiplication of the
virus was possible in Aedes aegypti.
Treatment
The therapy was symptomatic. Antibiotics were
used prophylactically against secondary bacterial
infections. Acute renal failure was treated according
to standard rules including peritoneal dialysis. Low
sodium human albumin was infused in patients with
hypoproteinaemia, and electrolytes and fluid supple-
mented. The most difficult problem was the treat-
ment of the haemorrhagic diathesis. Fresh blood
thrombocyte
concentrates,
fibrinogen,
e-amino-
caproic acid, vitamin K and the French preparation
PPSB
(Prothrombin,
Proconvertin,
Stuart-factor
and
antihaemophilicglobin
B)
were
given.
The
latter proved to be the most efficient.

Course and prognosis
The disease varied greatly in severity. There were
some mild cases but most of the patients were
critically ill. The fatality rate was 22%. Complete
recovery was the rule, but most patients even now
after
5 years complain about easy fatiguability,
inability to concentrate, loss of libido,
etc. It is
very difficult to decide what
complaints have a
real background or which symptoms are due to the
unique situation, as all infections were acknowledged
as occupational hazards and the pension scheme
makes
it
necessary
that
follow-up
studies
are
required every year. So a kind of post-Marburg
virus disease neurosis might play a role.
