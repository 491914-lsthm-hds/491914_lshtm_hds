Molecular 
evolutionary 
analyses 
for Ebola and Marburg viruses were conducted 
with the aim of elucidating 
evo- 
lutionary 
features of these viruses. In particular, the rate of nonsynonymous 
substitutions 
for the glycoprotein 
gene 
of Ebola virus was estimated 
to be, on the average, 3.6 X 1O-5 per site per year. Marburg virus was also suggested 
to be evolving 
at a similar rate. Those rates were a hundred 
times slower than those of retroviruses 
and human 
influenza 
A virus, but were of the same order of magnitude 
as that of hepatitis 
B virus. When these rates were 
applied to the degree of sequence divergence, 
the divergence 
time between Ebola and Marburg viruses was estimated 
to be more than several thousand 
years ago. Moreover, 
most of the nucleotide 
substitutions 
were transitions 
and 
synonymous 
for Marburg virus. This suggests 
that purifying 
selection 
has operated 
on Marburg virus during evo- 
lution. 
Introduction 
Ebola 
and Marburg 
viruses 
are known 
to be the 
etiological 
agents 
of haemorrhagic 
fever, which has a 
high mortality 
rate (Martini 
and Siegert 
197 1; Interna- 
tional 
Commission 
1978; 
WHO/International 
Study 
Team 1978; Baron, McCormick, 
and Zubeir 
1983; Cen- 
ters for Disease 
Control 
and Prevention 
1995), and thus 
have been classified 
as “biosafety 
level 4” agents (Rich- 
ardson and Barkley 
1988). These viruses have also been 
classified 
into the genus 
Filovirus, 
which 
is the sole 
member 
of the family 
Filoviridue 
(Riley 
et al. 1982). 
The genome 
of these viruses is the nonsegmented, 
neg- 
ative-stranded 
RNA 
(Regnery, 
Johnson, 
and Kiley 
1981), and thus they have been further 
classified 
into 
the order Mononegavirales 
(Pringle 
1991). Their 
ge- 
nomes encode the same set of seven genes in the same 
order, namely 
nucleoprotein 
(NP), viral structural 
pro- 
tein 35 (VP35), VP40, glycoprotein 
(GP), VP30, VP24, 
and RNA-dependent 
RNA polymerase 
(L), from the 3’ 
to 5’ end (Feldmann 
et al. 1992; Sanchez 
et al. 1993). 
From the molecular 
evolutionary 
point of view, it 
is of importance 
to elucidate 
the origins 
and evolution- 
ary modes of these viruses. 
In particular, 
to examine 
the 
rates and patterns 
of nucleotide 
substitutions 
for these 
viruses 
is important 
for understanding 
the mutation 
mechanism, 
and it is also useful for predicting 
the future 
evolution 
of these viruses. 
Such knowledge 
can lead us 
to the development 
of antiviral 
drugs and effective 
vac- 
cines for Ebola and Mar-burg viruses. 
In this study, we 
estimated 
the rates of nucleotide 
substitutions 
for Ebola 
and Mar-burg viruses. 
Applying 
the estimated 
rates to 
the degree of sequence 
divergence, 
we further estimated 
the divergence 
time not only among Ebola virus strains 
but also between 
Ebola and Marburg 
viruses. 
The pat- 
tern of nucleotide 
substitutions 
is also discussed 
to clar- 
ify the evolutionary 
modes of these viruses. 
Key words: 
Ebola virus, Marburg 
virus, substitution 
rate, diver- 
gence time, substitution 
pattern, 
purifying 
selection.

Materials 
and Methods 
Sequence 
Data Used 
Sequence 
data for Ebola and Marburg 
viruses were 
collected 
from the international 
DNA data banks DDBJ/ 
EMBL/GenBank. 
The sequence 
data used in this study 
are summarized 
in table 1. In our analyses, 
we assumed 
that 
no sequences 
of Ebola 
and 
Marburg 
viruses 
changed 
after isolation. 
If these viruses did change their 
genome 
sequences 
after isolation, 
the rates of nucleotide 
substitutions 
estimated 
in the present analysis 
would be 
underestimates, 
but they would 
still give us important 
information. 
Rates of Nonsynonymous 
Substitutions 
for Ebola and 
Mar-burg Viruses 
We first made alignments 
of homologous 
sequences 
for Ebola 
and Marburg 
viruses 
using 
CLUSTAL 
W 
(Thompson, 
Higgins, 
and 
Gibson 
1994). 
Then, 
the 
neighbor-joining 
method 
(Saitou 
and Nei 
1987) was 
used for constructing 
phylogenetic 
trees, with the dis- 
tances estimated 
using the method of Nei and Gojobori 
(1986). The reliability 
of clustering 
in the phylogenetic 
trees was tested by the bootstrap 
method with 1000 rep- 
lications 
(Felsenstein 
1985). 
Phylogenetic 
trees were 
constructed 
for all genes for the number 
of nonsynon- 
ymous 
substitutions. 
Unfortunately, 
we could not con- 
struct phylogenetic 
trees for synonymous 
substitutions, 
because the number 
of synonymous 
substitutions 
among 
different 
virus strains of Ebola virus or between 
Ebola 
and Marburg 
viruses 
was so large that we could 
not 
estimate 
it accurately. 
We also could not estimate 
the 
substitution 
rate of Ebola virus for all genes except the 
GP gene, because 
sequence 
data for Ebola virus were 
available 
for only one strain in other genes. The rates 
were estimated 
from the phylogenetic 
trees by dividing 
the difference 
in branch lengths of two strains of interest 
from the last common 
ancestor by the difference 
in their 
isolation 
times. 
In the case of the GP gene of Ebola 
virus, however, 
we excluded 
the sequences 
of Marburg 
virus in constructing 
the phylogenetic 
tree, because 
we 
could estimate 
branch 
lengths 
accurately 
by using only 
Ebola 
virus 
strains. 
Then, 
we made comparisons 
be- 
tween all possible pairs of viral sequences 
from the same 
subtype 
to avoid getting large variances.

NOTE.--This table shows genes, accession numbers of the sequence data in DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank, 
virus names, places and times of outbreaks, codon numbers 
of gene regions examined, 
and references. Several gaps were conducted in the analyzed regions in sequence alignments. 
The divergence 
times 
among 
Ebola 
virus 
strains 
and between 
Ebola and Mar-burg viruses were estimated 
on the assumption 
that these viruses 
had evolved 
at al- 
most the same substitution 
rate. 
Patterns 
of Nucleotide 
Substitutions 
for Mat-burg Virus 
The pattern 
of nucleotide 
substitutions 
was exam- 
ined for two Marburg 
virus strains for which the entire 
genome 
sequences 
were 
available 
(DDBJ/EMBL/ 
GenBank 
accession 
numbers 
M727 14 and 212132, 
and 
229337). 
All nucleotide 
changes between 
them were as- 
sumed to have occurred 
through 
single-nucleotide 
sub- 
stitutions. 
This assumption 
is reasonable 
because the nu- 
cleotide 
sequences 
of these strains were closely 
related 
(94%-97% 
identity). 
The numbers 
of substitutions 
be- 
tween two particular 
nucleotides 
were summed 
up, and 
the values 
thus obtained 
were corrected 
by base com- 
positions 
using the method 
of Gojobori, 
Li, and Graur 
(1982). The corrected 
values 
represent 
the substitution 
numbers 
from a particular 
nucleotide 
to another 
one in 
100 nucleotides 
of a hypothetical 
sequence 
which con- 
tains equal amounts 
of the four nucleotides. 
Results and Discussion 
Rates of Nonsynonymous 
Substitutions 
for Ebola and 
Mar-burg Viruses 
The rates of nonsynonymous 
substitutions 
for Ebo- 
la and Marburg 
viruses 
are summarized 
in tables 2 and 
3, respectively. 
Unfortunately, 
we could not estimate the 
rate of synonymous 
substitutions 
because the number 
of 
synonymous 
substitutions 
among different 
virus strains 
of Ebola virus or between 
Ebola and Mar-burg viruses 
was so large that we could not estimate 
it accurately. 
We also could not estimate the substitution 
rate of Ebola 
virus for all genes except the GP gene, because sequence 
data for Ebola virus were available 
for only one strain 
in other genes. 
For Ebola 
virus, 
the average 
rate of nonsynony- 
mous substitutions 
for the GP gene was estimated 
to be 
3.6 X 10e5 per site per year (table 
2). The value 
of 
standard error appeared to be relatively 
large. This might 
be due to the relatively 
small 
difference 
in isolation 
times compared 
with the slow rate of nucleotide 
substi- 
tutions. 
However, 
the rate was estimated 
to be at the 
same order in almost all comparisons, 
as shown in table 
2. Negative 
values were obtained 
in the estimations 
for 
the NP, VP40, GP, and L genes of Marburg 
virus, which 
would be due to statistical 
fluctuations 
because 
of the 
relatively 
large distances 
between 
Ebola 
and Mar-burg 
viruses. However, the values for VP35, VP30, and VP24 
indicate 
that Mar-burg virus is evolving 
at the rate of 
10-5 to 10-4 per site per year. These rates were com- 
pared with those of other RNA viruses and mammals 
in 
table 4. Most of the RNA viruses 
are known 
to evolve

be so error-prone. 
Second, the replication 
frequency 
may 
be relatively 
low in the natural host in comparison 
with 
retroviruses 
and human 
influenza 
A virus. 
Third, 
the 
number 
of the reservoir 
of these viruses 
in nature may 
be relatively 
small probably 
because 
of a low level of 
infectivity 
of these viruses. 
Finally, 
strong 
functional 
constraints 
may be operating 
on these viruses 
during 
evolution, 
particularly 
on GP and VP30, for we focused 
only on nonsynonymous 
substitutions, 
which change the 
coding amino acid. When we examined 
the rates of syn- 
onymous 
substitutions 
for Ebola 
and Mar-burg viruses, 
they were estimated 
to be at most 1.35 X 10e2 and 1.77 
X 10e2 per site per year, respectively. 
The rates of syn- 
onymous 
substitutions 
for retroviruses 
and human influ- 
enza A virus have been estimated 
to be 10m2 to 10e3 
(Hayashida 
et al. 1985; Li, Tanimura, 
and Sharp 1988; 
Gojobori, 
Moriyama, 
and Kimura 
1990; Gojobori 
et al. 
1994). Thus, we could not rule out the possibility 
that 
the relatively 
slow rates of nonsynonymous 
substitutions 
for Ebola and Marburg 
viruses 
were due to the strong 
functional 
constraint 
while the mutation 
rates were as 
high as those of retroviruses 
and human 
influenza 
A 
virus. In particular, 
a part of the GP gene region of Ebola 
virus has been reported to encode two different 
proteins 
in different 
frames by transcriptional 
editing 
(Volchkov 
et al. 1995; Sanchez 
et al. 1996). Such a region 
could 
be influenced 
by a strong 
functional 
constraint. 
Al- 
though we have excluded 
that region from our analysis, 
we could not rule out the possibility 
that there are other 
overlapping 
regions currently 
unknown. 
At any rate, the 
relatively 
slow 
rate 
of nonsynonymous 
substitutions 
may be useful 
for establishing 
effective 
vaccines 
for 
these viruses, 
because 
the rate of emergence 
of a new 
phenotype 
as a source of the human 
infection 
may also 
be slow. 
Divergence 
Times Among 
Ebola Virus Strains and 
Between 
Ebola and Marburg 
Viruses 
The divergence 
times 
among 
Ebola 
virus 
strains 
and between 
Ebola and Marburg 
viruses were estimated 
on the assumption 
that these viruses had evolved 
at al- 
most the same substitution 
rate. Ebola virus strains are 
known 
to be classified 
into four subtypes: 
Zaire, Sudan, 
Reston, 
and Ivory 
Coast 
subtypes 
(fig. 1). From 
the 
analysis 
of the rate of nonsynonymous 
substitutions 
for 
the GP gene of Ebola virus, we estimated 
that the Zaire 
and Ivory 
Coast 
subtypes 
diverged 
700-1,300 
years 
ago, the Sudan 
and Reston 
subtypes 
diverged 
1,400- 
1,600 
years 
ago, 
and 
these 
two 
clusters 
diverged 
l,OOO-2,100 
years ago. Moreover, 
the divergence 
time 
between 
Ebola and Marburg 
viruses was estimated 
to be 
7,100-7,900 
years ago. Similarly, 
from the analysis 
of 
the rate of nonsynonymous 
substitutions 
for Marburg 
virus, we estimated 
that these viruses 
diverged 
l,OOO- 
9,800 years ago (table 3). Thus, although the divergence

times estimated 
are in the wide range, we conclude 
that 
Ebola and Mar-burg viruses 
diverged 
more than several 
thousand 
years ago. 
The divergence 
time between 
human 
immunodefi- 
ciency virus type 1 (HIV-l) 
and type 2 (HIV-2) has been 
estimated 
to be 150-200 
years ago (Gojobori, 
Moriya- 
ma, and Yokoyama 
1988). Moreover, 
hepatitis 
C virus 
has been estimated 
to have diverged 
from its ancestor 
around 
300 years ago (Mizokami, 
Gojobori, 
and Lau 
1994). 
In comparison 
with the estimated 
divergence 
times for these prevalent 
pathogenic 
viruses, 
Ebola and 
Marburg 
viruses 
might have diverged 
much earlier. 
Patterns 
of Nucleotide 
Substitutions 
for Marburg 
Virus 
The patterns 
of nucleotide 
substitutions 
at the first 
and second codon positions 
and the third codon position 
for Mar-burg virus were examined 
separately, 
as sum- 
marized 
in table 5. As most of the nucleotide 
substitu- 
tions at the first and second codon positions 
change cod- 
ing amino 
acids, the substitution 
pattern 
at these posi- 
tions 
would 
be influenced 
by natural 
selection 
at the 
protein 
level. On the other hand, as most of the substi- 
tutions 
at the third codon position 
do not change coding 
amino 
acids, 
nucleotide 
changes 
at that position 
are 
mostly 
free from natural 
selection 
(Kimura 
1983) and 
reflect, to some extent, the pattern 
of spontaneous 
mu- 
tations in the genome. 
At the third codon 
position 
in the entire 
coding 
region 
of Mar-burg 
virus, 
the proportion 
of transition 
substitutions 
was 90%, which was much larger than that 
of transversion 
substitutions. 
Furthermore, 
among tran- 
sition substitutions, 
the frequencies 
of substitutions 
be- 
tween purines 
were almost the same as those between 
pyrimidines. 
This feature of transition 
substitutions 
for 
Marburg 
virus 
is similar 
to that of influenza 
A virus 
(Saitou 
1987). For HIV (Shimizu 
et al. 1989; Moriyama 
et al. 1991) and oncoviruses 
(Gojobori 
and Yokoyama 
1987), however, 
substitution 
between 
purines 
is more 
frequent 
than that between 
pyrimidines. 
Although 
HIV 
and oncoviruses 
replicate 
themselves 
with reverse tran- 
scriptase, Marburg 
virus and influenza 
A virus have their 
own RNA-dependent 
RNA polymerase. 
Thus, the dif- 
ference 
in transition 
substitutions 
among 
these viruses 
appears to reflect differences 
in the generating 
mecha- 
nisms of spontaneous 
mutations 
with viral polymerases. 
We also investigated 
the pattern of nucleotide 
sub- 
stitutions 
at the first and second codon positions 
of Mar- 
burg 
virus 
to examine 
whether 
any 
functional 
con- 
straints 
are imposed 
on amino 
acid changes. 
For this 
purpose, 
we calculated 
the correlation 
coefficients 
be- 
tween the frequencies 
of nucleotide 
substitutions 
at var- 
ious codon positions 
and the chemical 
distances 
between 
two nucleotide 
bases, as defined 
by Gojobori, 
Li, and 
Graur (1982) (table 5). The chemical 
distance 
between 
two nucleotides 
was defined 
using 
Grantham’s 
(1974) 
chemical 
distances 
between 
two amino 
acids. When 
a 
correlation 
coefficient 
is negative, 
it is possible 
that pu- 
rifying 
selection 
may be operating 
on the nucleotide 
substitutions. 
Using 
this 
method, 
Gojobori, 
Li, and 
Graur (1982) demonstrated 
that purifying 
selection 
has 
operated 
on most of the eukaryotic 
functional 
genes. 
Saitou (1987) suggested 
that purifying 
selection 
has also 
operated 
on influenza 
A virus. For Mar-burg virus, the 
correlation 
coefficients 
were -0.35 
for the first and sec- 
ond codon positions 
and -0.25 
for the third codon po- 
sition. Thus, it seems that the correlation 
coefficient 
for 
the first and second codon positions 
is larger than that 
for the third codon 
position, 
indicating 
that purifying 
selection 
has operated 
on Mar-burg virus during 
evolu- 
tion. 
This conclusion 
is supported 
by a recent study (Bu- 
kreyev et al. 1995b), in which 72.6% of the nucleotide 
substitutions 
in the entire coding 
region 
were found at 
the third codon position 
between 
the two strains of Mar- 
burg virus analyzed 
in this study. This is because 
puri- 
fying selection 
results in more frequent 
nucleotide 
sub- 
stitutions 
at the third codon position 
than at the first and 
second codon positions 
(Kimura 
1983). We also calcu- 
lated the numbers 
of synonymous 
and nonsynonymous 
substitutions 
for the entire coding region between 
those 
two 
strains 
using 
the method 
of Nei 
and 
Gojobori 
(1986). 
The numbers 
of synonymous 
and nonsynony- 
mous substitutions 
were estimated 
to be 0.180 5 0.008 
per site and 0.017 + 0.001 per site, respectively. 
Thus, 
the number 
of synonymous 
substitutions 
was signifi- 
cantly 
higher 
than that of nonsynonymous 
ones (P < 
0.001). This suggests 
that purifying 
selection 
has oper- 
ated on Mar-burg virus during 
evolution, 
because 
syn- 
onymous 
substitutions 
are considered 
to be selectively 
neutral 
at the protein 
level, 
whereas 
nonsynonymous 
substitutions 
are influenced 
by selective 
constraints 
(Ki- 
mura 1983; Hughes and Nei 1988, 1989). The purifying 
selection 
would be caused by the functional 
constraint 
for viral proteins. 
The pattern of nucleotide 
substitutions 
and the de- 
gree of functional 
constraints, 
which were estimated 
in 
the present 
study, are useful for the development 
of an- 
tiviral drugs and effective 
vaccines. 
In particular, 
inhib- 
itors against 
viral replication 
will be able to be devel- 
oped by taking 
into account 
the pattern 
of nucleotide 
substitutions. 
Moreover, 
if more data for the genome 
sequences 
of Ebola virus become 
available, 
it will be

possible to identify 
the gene product targeted by the host 
immune 
system, by comparing 
the degrees of functional 
constraints 
gene by gene. This is because 
the degree of 
functional 
constraints 
may vary with genes in the viral 
genome 
depending 
on the variability 
of amino acids. 
In this study, we found that the GP gene of Ebola 
virus is evolving 
at the average rate of 3.6 X lop5 per 
site per year at the nonsynonymous 
site, and that Mar- 
burg virus is evolving 
at a similar rate. These rates are 
of almost the same order of magnitude, 
but somewhat 
slow, in comparison 
with other RNA viruses. 
In partic- 
ular, those 
rates 
are approximately 
a hundred 
times 
slower than those of retroviruses 
and human 
influenza 
A virus. We also estimated 
the divergence 
time between 
Ebola 
and Mat-burg 
viruses 
to be more 
than 
several 
thousand 
years ago. In addition, 
the pattern of nucleotide 
substitutions 
for Mar-burg virus indicated 
that the puri- 
fying 
selection 
has operated 
on this virus during 
evo- 
lution. 
These results 
will be useful 
in elucidating 
the 
origin and evolution 
of Ebola and Marburg 
viruses. 
To 
confirm 
and extend 
our observations, 
more 
sequence 
data for estimating 
the rate of synonymous 
substitutions 
and experimental 
studies on the mutation 
rates of Ebola 
and Marburg 
viruses 
would be required.
