Background.
Occupational transmission to health workers (HWs) has been a typical feature of Marburg
hemorrhagic fever (MHF) outbreaks. The goal of this study was to identify cases of occupational MHF in HWs
from Durba and Watsa, Democratic Republic of the Congo; to assess levels of exposure and protection; and to
explore reasons for inconsistent use of protective gear.
Methods.
A serosurvey of 48 HWs who cared for patients with MHF was performed. In addition, HWs were
given a questionnaire on types of exposure, use of protective gear, and symptoms after contact. Informal and in-
depth interviews with HWs were also performed.
Results.
We found 1 HW who was seropositive for MHF, in addition to 5 cases of occupational MHF known
beforehand; 4 infections had occurred after the introduction of infection control. HWs protected themselves better
during invasive procedures (injections, venipuncture, and surgery) than during noninvasive procedures, but the
overall level of protection in the hospital remained insufﬁcient, particularly outside of isolation wards. The reasons
for inconsistent use of protective gear included insufﬁcient availability of the gear, adherence to traditional ex-
planatory models of the origin of disease, and peer bonding with sick colleagues.
Conclusions.
Infection control must not focus too exclusively on the establishment of isolation wards but
should aim at improving overall hospital hygiene. Training of HWs should allow them to voice and discuss their
doubts and prepare them for the peculiarities of caring for ill colleagues.
Between October 1998 and September 2000, a major
Marburg hemorrhagic fever (MHF) outbreak occurred
in Durba and Watsa, northeastern Democratic Republic
of the Congo (DRC). Repeated introductions of Mar-

burg virus (MARV) from the unknown animal reservoir
are thought to have occurred in the Gorumbwa gold
mine. Numerous primary cases occurred among illegal
gold miners, who transmitted MARV to family mem-
bers and health workers (HWs) [1, 2].
Until May 1999, HWs in Durba and Watsa had
worked with hardly any protection, because the eco-
nomic crisis and armed conﬂict in eastern DRC had
left health services with insufﬁcient supplies. This re-
sulted in 2 cases of occupational MHF in HWs, in-
cluding in the me

May 1999 [1]. Two isolation wards in Durba and Watsa
were established; HWs were trained in the clinical di-
agnosis and management of MHF, including barrier
nursing; and supplies were provided for isolation wards
[4, 5]. The outbreak investigation in May 1999 included
a serosurvey of 103 HWs; all serum samples were neg-

ative for Marburg IgG [2]. Until September 2000, Durba and
Watsa were visited repeatedly by experts from the World Health
Organization (WHO) and Me
´decins Sans Frontie
`res (MSF),
who reinforced training and replenished stocks of protective
gear.
Between May 1999 and September 2000, 3 more cases of
occupational MHF occurred in HWs [1]. On the basis of the
assumption that difﬁculties in supplying protective materialand
in maintaining appropriate hospital hygiene could have resulted
in further cases of occupational MHF, we conducted another
HW serosurvey in 2001–2002 and explored the use of protective
gear and reasons for any inconsistent use.
METHODS
Most patients with MHF were known through surveillance ini-
tiated in May 1999 and our own investigations [6]. We targeted
HWs who had had a professional contact with a patient with
MHF or with his or her body ﬂuids. This patient had to have
laboratory-conﬁrmed MHF (positive results of polymerase
chain reaction, antigen-capture ELISA, or virus isolation), or,
if laboratory conﬁrmation was not performed, the patient had
to be epidemiologically linked to a conﬁrmed case (i.e., the
patient had to fulﬁll the MHF clinical case deﬁnition and report
physical contact with a laboratory-conﬁrmed case within 3 days
to 3 weeks before onset of symptoms, while no attempt at
laboratory conﬁrmation had been undertaken). HWs who had
contact only with suspected cases were ineligible.
Heads of health facilities provided lists of HWs who had
treated patients with MHF. We approached these HWs unless
we were prevented from doing so by distance or lack of security.
After giving informed consent, HWs were asked which patients
with MHF they had treated, to differentiate contacts before and
after the outbreak response began, and they were asked whether
they had given noninvasive (e.g., taking temperatures, blood
pressure, nursing) or invasive (e.g., injections, venipuncture,
surgery) care. For each type of activity, we asked whether gloves
or full protective gear (FPG; gum boots, scrub suit, gown,
apron, mask, goggles, headwear, and 2 pairs of gloves) had
always, sometimes, or never been used, as well as whether pa-
tients had started vomiting, having diarrhea, or bleeding when
the activity was performed. Scores for glove use, FPG use, and
overall protection were computed (table 1). We asked whether
HWs had experienced symptoms corresponding to the clinical
case deﬁnition (table 2) in the 4 weeks after contact.
We collected 5–10 mL of venous blood, let the blood clot
for ∼12 h, extracted serum, and kept it at 4C until arrival at
the National Institute for Communicable Diseases, Johannes-
burg, South Africa. ELISA [7] (with antigen derived from
MARV Musoke) and indirect immunoﬂuorescence assay [8]
(with antigen prepared by the National Institute for Com-
municable Diseases) were used to detect IgG antibodies as
markers for earlier MARV infection. Given their undeﬁned
speciﬁcity, both test results had to be positive for serum to be
considered positive for anti-Marburg IgG.
Interview and serological data were double entered, validated
using Epi Info (version 6.04; Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention), and analyzed with STATA (version 9.0; StataCorp),
using 2-sided Fisher exact tests for differences in proportions.
We estimated the frequency of occupational MHF, using as
the denominator the duration of the outbreak (7 vs. 16
months), the number of all patients with MHF in the zone (80
vs. 77 patients [1, 2, 6]), or the number of patients with MHF
seeking health care (56 vs. 47 patients [M.B., unpublished
data]), before and after the introduction of barrier nursing.
Because most cases of MHF before the introduction of barrier
nursing were ascertained retrospectively, the denominators in-
cluded suspected cases.
To explore the circumstances of transmission and the reasons
for inconsistent use of gloves and FPG, we had informal dis-
cussions with study participants and 2 in-depth interviews with
key HW informants, both of whom were signiﬁcantly involved
in MHF surveillance and clinical care of patients with MHF.
The interviews were recorded and analyzed manually.
This study was approved by the ethics committee of the
Institute for Tropical Medicine in Antwerp, Belgium, and by
the local representative of the Ministry of Health in Watsa.
RESULTS
Study participants.
Sixty-three HWs were listed as having
treated patients with MHF; 4 of them had died of conﬁrmed
MHF, and 1 (Mr. C; see the Appendix, which appears only in
the online edition of the Journal) had survived conﬁrmed MHF
but was unavailable for interview. The whereabouts of 3 HWs
were unknown, but they were reported to have survived the
outbreak. Five HWs now worked outside of Watsa HZ; distance
or lack of security prevented us from contacting them. All 8
absentees had reportedly not had typical MHF symptoms. Of
the 50 interviewed HWs, 2 were excluded from analysis because
they lacked direct contact with a patient with MHF. Our study
population, therefore, included 48 (84%) of the 57 eligible
HWs, including 2 HWs from outside of Watsa HZ.
Distributions of sex, age, workplace, and profession are re-
ported in table 3. Six HWs had been assigned to an isolation
ward during the outbreak; the others had treated patients with
MHF before isolation wards were established or afterward but
outside of isolation wards (either before MHF had been di-
agnosed or after diagnosis but before referral to an isolation
ward).
Exposure and protection.
In total, 96% of the participants
had provided noninvasive health care, and 83% had provided
invasive health care (table 1). Approximately 90% of these ac-
tivities were performed on patients experiencing diarrhea,vom-

remained unchanged, but consistent glove use increased sig-
niﬁcantly, from 0% to 23% of all activities (
) (table 4).
P p .03
The score for glove use (as a percentage of the maximum score)
rose from 6% to 39%, but care was still provided to patients
with MHF without ever using gloves (45%) or FPG (68%).
Of 6 HWs assigned to isolation wards, 2 treated patients with
MHF only after the introduction of barrier nursing. None of
them reported consistent use of gloves and FPG.
Circumstances of transmission of MARV to HWs.
One
HW (Ms. B) was seropositive, and all other participants were
seronegative, including 4 whose serum samples had low IFA
titers (1:8–1:16) unconﬁrmed by ELISA; no samples had both
positive ELISA results and negative IFA results. Eight HWs
(17%) reported fever plus at least 3 general symptoms and had
conditions that fulﬁlled the clinical case deﬁnition of MHF;
nobody reported fever plus hemorrhage (table 2). Adding Ms.
B (who reported only fever) to the previously identiﬁed cases
gives a total of 6 HWs with occupational MHF (for detailed
symptoms and laboratory results, see table 2; for details of
exposure, see the Appendix). All had direct contact with pa-
tients with MHF, and 4 had contact with their blood. Five did
not use gloves, 1 used gloves inconsistently, and none used
FPG. Two cases occurred before barrier nursing was introduced,
and 3 HWs acquired occupational MHF outside the isolation
wards; these 5 infections were transmitted from patients who
were not yet suspected to have MHF. The sixth HW acquired
occupational MHF in the isolation ward, refusing to use pro-
tective gear when caring for a relative.
The frequency of occupational MHF among HWs before and
after the launch of disease control, calculated using the 3 de-
nominators described in Methods, was as follows: per year,
cases versus
cases; per 100 pa-

differences were not statistically signiﬁcant, suggesting that the
frequency of occupational MHF remained, at best, unchanged
by the introduction of barrier nursing.
HWs became victims of the MHF outbreak even if they were
spared from transmission of the virus. After the death of Dr.
A, 2 HWs were accused of poisoning him (see the Appendix
for details).
Reasons for not using gloves and FPG.
Interviewees
reported that glove use was rare before the introduction of
barrier nursing. After the introduction, protective gear was
available in principle, with stocks being replenished by visiting
WHO or MSF teams. However, temporary shortages of single-
use items, including gloves, allegedly occurred. This protective
material was meant to be used in isolation wards, and supplies
outside of the isolation wards were reported to be insufﬁcient
for systematic infection control. According to our interviewees,
training focused on the use of protective gear when treating
patients with suspected MHF in isolation wards; universal pre-
cautions when caring for any patients were less well covered.
The key informants reported that the “limited awareness of the
need to protect oneself when treating patients not suspected to
suffer from MHF, and the limited availability of gloves on the
surgical ward may have contributed to the transmission of
MARV to nurses E and F” (see the Appendix).
We found that HWs sometimes chose not to use FPG, despite
having awareness of the risks. One of our key informants, Dr.
Z, reported that he embraced Dr. A at an advanced stage of
his disease, without any protective gear. Although the exact
nature of Dr. A’s disease was unknown to them at that time,
both suspected human-to-human transmission and were aware
of the high case fatality. Dr. Z usually took precautions to
protect himself but, on this occasion, took the risk, “feeling
compelled to make this gesture of encouragement and solidarity
for a colleague and close friend.” He added that physicians in
remote areas are few and far between and, therefore, form a
family. The other key informant, Mr. Y, who was very expe-
rienced in handling patients with MHF, reported that, when
his colleague Mr. F became ill with MHF, he felt “it would be
too cruel to use FPG, as this would have signaled Mr. F that
there was little hope for survival.” Our informant “did not have
the heart” to wear FPG and treated Mr. F without protection.

a Maximum score, 2.
b Protection score: 0, never gloves (hence never FPG); 1, sometimes gloves, never FPG; 2, sometimes gloves, sometimes FPG or always gloves, never FPG;
3, always gloves, sometimes FPG; 4 (maximum), always FPG (hence always gloves).
No transmission of MARV occurred on either occasion. Both
informants underlined that, in general, patients do not like
HWs to wear gloves and sometimes take offense, as if the use
of gloves suggests that the patient is dirty.
The key informants declared that HWs may not use FPG
because they do not fully accept the biomedical explanatory
model of human-to-human transmission of a pathogen but
remain attracted to the traditional model of deliberate poison-
ing; they suggested that the failure to clarify the etiology of the
1994 MHF outbreak in time may have reinforced this attitude.
HWs were reported to reason that “as not everybody with a
high level of exposure became infected there must be something
else to it than transmission by contact.” It was suggested that
this may explain why Ms. D, despite warnings, refused to use
FPG when caring for her relative or for her remains. Her med-
ical background notwithstanding, Ms. D behaved like family
members of other patients with MHF, who could not be pre-
vented from embracing their loved ones or performing tradi-
tional burial rites without protection.
Interviewees emphasized the history of similar, albeit smaller,
outbreaks in the area. The local population, including local
HWs, had become used to this recurrent phenomenon, coining
the term “Syndrome de Durba”; this habituation reportedly re-
duced levels of concern and fear. The sociopolitical environ-
ment was also put forward as an explanation. Watsa and Durba
had seen years of economic decline and insecurity and wit-
nessed a gold rush with an inﬂux of risk-taking orpailleurs.
MHF was not necessarily the most important of the many risks
people had to live with, and “HWs allowed themselves to be
inﬂuenced by the prevailing risk-taking mentality” (Dr. Z).
Finally, the key informants made the point that a protracted
outbreak requires continuous nosocomial infection control,
which would necessitate a sustained change of behavior in-
grained by routine for many years—a challenge in any setting.
DISCUSSION
One year after the MHF outbreak in Watsa and Durba, we
conducted a survey of HWs who had treated patients with MHF.
This delay may have reduced the accuracy of the reporting of
exposures and protection, and we lost some statistical power
by no longer being able to establish the precise timing of ex-
posure for some HWs. Nevertheless, the ﬁnding of grossly in-
sufﬁcient levels of protection is clearly valid. It was corroborated
by interviewing experienced and insightful key informants, who
also provided possible reasons for nonuse of protectivematerial.
In Durba and Watsa, 6 occupational MHF cases in HWs
occurred in 1998–2000, and 3 occurred in 1994 [1]. This cor-
roborates the observation that multiple cases among HWs are
characteristic of ﬁloviral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks in Africa
whenever there is a formal health system at the epidemic site.
We found serological evidence for past MARV infection in 1
HW, who reported only mild fever after the putative exposure.
This is consistent with earlier ﬁndings that mild or asymptom-
atic MHF cases are rare [6]. Interestingly, this HW had a pre-
vious negative IgG test result 18 days after the putative expo-
sure; the mildness of her disease and the delayed detectable
IgG response may both have been due to a small infectious
dose. Many seronegative HWs reported symptoms fulﬁlling the
MHF case deﬁnition, which underlines the difﬁculty in diag-
nosing early MHF on clinical grounds alone and the importance
of swift laboratory conﬁrmation. The ranking of symptoms was

almost the same as in seronegative community contacts [6],
but symptoms were less frequent in HWs.
Hospital hygiene and the use of protective gear were insuf-
ﬁcient in Watsa and Durba, despite improvement compared
with the period before disease control was in place. Glove use
should have been universal. Universal FPG use cannot be re-
alistically expected outside of isolation wards—but, then again,
this calls into question the impact of barrier nursing on overall
biosafety for HWs. The frequent use of invasive techniques,
including IM injections, further suggests the absence of a com-
prehensive infection control strategy.
However, HWs used resources rationally: they used gloves
and FPG more frequently for invasive than for noninvasive
procedures. Given the need for protective material outside of
the isolation wards, they bent the donor-imposed rules and
employed multiple-use material in the operating theater.
None of the 6 cases of occupational MHF occurred in HWs
who used FPG at the time of exposure. Although the availability
of protective material was inadequate before May 1999, stocks
were later sufﬁcient to cover the isolation wards’ needs; all items
were still available in 2001 (S.M., unpublished data). Outside
of the isolation wards, the availability of protective material did
not fundamentally improve. HWs, confronted with an unex-
pected hemorrhage, were therefore tempted to handle the prob-
lem without appropriate protection. Not surprisingly, we found
no evidence that the frequency of occupational MHF in HWs
decreased after the introduction of barrier nursing. In this set-
ting, the availability of postexposure prophylaxis, which should
be given within a half hour after exposure [9], would have
made no difference either: the 6 HWs who became infected
did not realize their exposure before the onset of symptoms.
For these 6 “health-care workers in an outbreak of Marburg
virus or Ebola virus,” the advent of postexposure prophylaxis
was not really “good news” [10, p. 1374].
Our results underline the importance of not focusing too
narrowly on barrier nursing in isolation wards, which should
be only 1 element of a wider strategy for infection control in
health facilities. The clinical diagnosis of ﬁloviral hemorrhagic
fever can be difﬁcult in the ﬁrst days of disease; unsuspecting
HWs may not protect themselves sufﬁciently if universal pre-
cautions are not ﬁrmly established in their daily routine. Gen-
eral precautions (including the use of gloves, hand disinfection,
and sharps management) need to be reinforced everywhere,
alternatives to invasive therapies need to be established where
possible, and a ﬁloviral hemorrhagic fever screeningmechanism
needs to be set up at hospital entry. This task is logistically
challenging and resource intensive, and conditions in Watsa
and Durba were not conducive to implementing it. The task
also suffered from the absence of a single protagonist with
overall responsibility. As in past outbreaks, ﬁeld epidemiology
was carried out by the WHO, the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, and others, and isolation wards were estab-
lished by MSF. Nosocomial infection control outside of isola-
tion wards was, at least in Watsa, “no man’s land.” The MHF
outbreak in Uige, Angola, in 2005 may have changed this for
the good: nosocomial transmission of MARV fueled the out-
break to such an extent that MSF took responsibility for in-
fection control in the whole hospital, and nosocomial trans-
mission was brought to an end [11]. Furthermore, the challenge
for protracted outbreaks like the one in Watsa is not only to
introduce but to maintain high standards of hospital hygiene.
Innovative, more energizing training methods—for example,
drills—could be tried as a complement to standard supervision
approaches.
However, a lack of resources or awareness does not fully
explain the nonuse of protective gear. We identiﬁed 2 main
reasons why HWs elected not to use available protective gear
despite better knowledge or explicit warnings: peer bonding
and traditional explanations.
HWs are part of the local community and may share popular
or traditional beliefs, like the explanatory model of “deliberate
poisoning,” particularly if they have received little formal ed-
ucation. The accusation that 2 HWs poisoned Dr. A was even
followed by health authorities seeking their imprisonment. This
illustrates how modern and traditional belief systems coexist.
Trainers should address doubts about the biomedical model,
and its acceptance by HWs should not be taken for granted.
HWs were more inclined to take risks when the patients with
MHF were HWs themselves. Rules may be bent in an open,
controlled way, without increased risk; violated because of an
impulse to peer bond with increased risk to the HW (Dr. Z
and Mr. Y above); and broken in acts of resistance to hospi-
talization (see the Appendix for examples). Peer bonding
among HWs may be particularly pronounced when they enjoy
a high social status, distancing them from other community
members, and when they work in remote settings, fostering
preparedness to support each other in coping. The open def-
inition of “family” may even further promote peer bonding.
Because care for peers with ﬁloviral hemorrhagic fever appears
to constitute a particular occupational hazard, training should
speciﬁcally address this emotional challenge.
Although we certainly have not exhausted this topic in the
present article, we have demonstrated that providing knowledge
and materials may not sufﬁce to make HWs use protective gear
with the rigor necessary for ﬁloviral hemorrhagic fever out-
breaks. HWs need to be prepared and supported beyond this.

†GEMINI I and II are two identical 148-week, phase III, randomised, double-blind, multicentre, 
parallel-group, non-inferiority, controlled clinical trials testing the eﬃcacy of DTG/3TC in 
treatment-naïve patients. Participants with screening HIV-1 RNA ≤500,000 copies/mL were 
randomised 1:1 to once-daily DTG/3TC (n=716, pooled) or DTG + TDF/FTC (n=717, pooled). The 
primary endpoint of each GEMINI study was the proportion of participants with plasma HIV-1 
RNA <50 copies/mL at Week 48 (ITT-E population, snapshot algorithm).13
‡STAT is a phase IIIb, open-label, 48-week, single-arm pilot study evaluating the feasibility, 
eﬃcacy, and safety of DTG/3TC in 131 newly diagnosed HIV-1 infected adults as a ﬁrst line 
regimen. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 
copies/mL at Week 24.6
§D2ARLING is a randomised, open-label, phase IV study designed to assess the eﬃcacy 
and safety of DTG/3TC in treatment-naïve people with HIV with no available baseline HIV-1 
resistance testing. Participants were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive DTG/3TC (n=106) or 
DTG + TDF/XTC (n=108). The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with plasma 
HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL at Week 48.7 Results at week 24 of the study.

¶TANGO is a randomised, open-label, trial testing the eﬃcacy of DOVATO in virologically 
suppressed patients. Participants were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive DOVATO (n=369) 
or continue with TAF-containing regimens (n=372) for up to 200 weeks. At Week 148, 298 of 
those on TAF-based regimens switched to DOVATO. The primary eﬃcacy endpoint was the 
proportion of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥50 copies/mL (virologic non-response) as per 
the FDA Snapshot category at Week 48 (adjusted for randomisation stratiﬁcation factor).8,13
#SALSA is a phase III, randomised, open-label, non-inferiority clinical trial evaluating the eﬃcacy 
and safety of switching to DTG/3TC compared with continuing current antiretroviral regimens 
in virologically suppressed adults with HIV. Eligible participants were randomised 1:1 to switch 
to once-daily DTG/3TC (n=246) or continue current antiretroviral regimens (n=247). The primary 
endpoint was the proportion of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥50 copies/mL at Week 48 (ITT-E 
population, snapshot algorithm).9
