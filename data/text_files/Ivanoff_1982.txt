Summary 
A serological enquiry aimed at determining the 
incidence of infection with Lassa, Ebola and Mat-burg 
viruses was conducted on the human population of 
the region of Haut-OgoouC (Gabon) and on primates. 
The results, obtained by the indirect immuno- 
fluorescence 
technique, showed that more than 6% of 
the human population had had contact with Ebola 
virus but no antibodies against Marburg or Lassa 
viruses were found. 
Most sera reacted to an Ebola antigen from a 
Zairian strain, but showed little or no reaction to an 
antigen from a Sudanese strain. 
Introduction 
The severity of Lassa, Ebola and Marburg virus 
outbreaks in the recent past, their potential for 
infection and the difficulties in treating the resulting 
illness make the pathological action of these 
viruses an 
urgent problem for the Public Health Services of 
Tropical Africa (BRES, 1978). 
In the framework of the research which we carry 
out at the Centre International de Recherches 
Medi- 
tales de Franceville (CIRMF) we have, in collabora- 
tion with the Institute Pasteur de Bangui, undertaken 
a serological inquiry aimed at determining the inci- 
dence of infection with these viruses in the human 
population in the Franceville area 
and in the primates 
of the CIRMF colony. 
There is a double interest in this study: one 
epidemiological, concerned with possible propagation 
of these agents, and the other public health, con- 
cerned with study of direct transmission from mother 
to infant and with possible infection of the foetus. 
Samples 
Material 
and Methods 
Samples were taken from man and primates as 
follows: 
(a) Human sera: 197 serum samples 
from adults were 
provided by the Service de Medecine du Travail; 28 
serum saniples from mothers 
and 28 from their 
newborn infants (umbilical cord) were collected at the 
Clique 
du La&. 
All these 
samples 
were collected between February 
13th and March 19th 1980. 
(b) Primate ma: 34 early serum and 14 late serum 
samples were collected from chimpanzees of the 
CIRMF colony. 
Viral antigens 
The inactive viral antigens, fixed on slides for 
immunofluorescence, were sent to us by the C.D.C., 
Atlanta, Georgia, USA. 
Method 
The technique of indirect immunofluorescence, 
described by WULFF & LANGE (1975), was used to 
search for antibodies against the Lassa, Ebola and 
Marburg viruses. After fixation by acetone, viral 
antigens were rinsed with PBS (ph 7.2) and exposed 
to serum samples; 
evidence 
of affinity was 
achieved 
by 
the use of fluorescein conjugated anti-immuno- 
globulin prepared against whole human or primate 
serum (Institute Pasteur? 
ref. 7455 for human serum 
and CAPPEL lab. for primates). Readings 
were taken 
with 
a 
fluorescence 
microscope 
POLYVAR 
(Reichert). 
Screening with polyvalent slides (a mixture of the 
three antigens) allowed the identificaton of positive 
serum samples which were subsequently tested on 
monovalent slides against each 
antigen. Two different 
antigens against Ebola virus were used, one from a 
Table I-Human 
serum reciprocal of antibodies against 
Ebola antigen Zaire strain and Sudan strain

the aim of improving our understanding of its mode of

Human 
samples 
Results 
Of the 253 human serum samples tested, none 
showed the presence of antibodies against Lassa or 
Marburg virus. In contrast, 19 serum samples, 
including one mother-infant pair, were positive 
against Bbola virus. 
The results against both strains of Ebola virus are 
shown in Table I. It shows that 16 samples, that is 
6.3% of the population examined, produced antibody 
titres higher than 1:16. The majority of samples 
produced antibodies against the Zaire strain and 
almost none against the Sudan strain. 
Transmission from mother to infant was observed 
only once in a stillborn baby. 
Primate 
samples 
All primate serum samples were found to be 
negative. 
Conclusion 
The analysis of human serum by immunofluores- 
cence against antigens of Lassa, Ebola and Marburg 
viruses 
shows that 6.3% possess 
antibodies against 
Ebola at a titre 2 l/16. These results confirm that this 
virus is widesuread in Central Africa (GONZALES et 
al., 1980; LA~GUILLAT et al., 1980; SALUZZO et al., 
1980a. b). It should be remembered that it was 
responsible for epidemics in Sudan and Zaire in 1976 
with high mortality rates both in the population and 
among hospital staff (BRES, 1978). 
Thus it was of interest to test the sera against a 
strain from Zaire and a strain from Sudan. The vast 
majority of positive sera 
reacted 
more strongly against 
the Ebola antigen from Zaire, which confirms the 
observations of different authors on the antigenic 
differences of the Zairian and Sudanese strains. 
The transmission of antibodies between mother and 
infant was found only once. The infant was stillborn 
and we could not perform a search 
for IgM because 
no 
sample was collected. 
These results emphasize the potential risk of 
outbreaks of Ebola virus in this region and we plan to
