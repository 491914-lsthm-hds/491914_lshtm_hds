Abstract 
Background:  In recent years there have been reports of viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF) epidemics in sub-Saharan 
Africa where malaria is endemic. VHF and malaria have overlapping clinical presentations making differential diagno‑
sis a challenge. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of selected zoonotic VHFs and malaria 
co-infections among febrile patients seeking health care in Tanzania.
Methods:  This facility-based cross-sectional study was carried out between June and November 2018 in Buhigwe, 
Kalambo, Kyela, Kilindi, Kinondoni, Kondoa, Mvomero, and Ukerewe districts in Tanzania. The study involved febrile 
patients seeking health care from primary healthcare facilities. Blood samples were collected and tested for infections 
due to malaria, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF), Ebola virus disease (EVD), Marburg virus disease (MVD), 
Rift Valley fever (RVF) and yellow fever (YF). Malaria infections were tested using rapid diagnostics tests while exposure 
to VHFs was determined by screening for immunoglobulin M antibodies using commercial enzyme-linked immuno‑
sorbent assays. The Chi-square test was used to compare the proportions.
Results:  A total of 308 participants (mean age = 35 ± 19 years) were involved in the study. Of these, 54 (17.5%) had 
malaria infection and 15 (4.8%) were positive for IgM antibodies against VHFs (RVF = 8; CCHF = 2; EBV = 3; MBV = 1; 
YF = 1). Six (1.9%) individuals had both VHF (RVF = 2; CCHF = 1; EVD = 2; MVD = 1) and malaria infections. The highest 
co-infection prevalence (0.6%) was observed among individuals aged 46‒60 years (P < 0.05). District was significantly 
associated with co-infection (P < 0.05) with the highest prevalence recorded in Buhigwe (1.2%) followed by Kinondoni 
(0.9%) districts. Headache (100%) and muscle, bone, back and joint pains (83.3%) were the most significant complaints 
among those infected with both VHFs and malaria (P = 0.001).
Conclusions:  Co-infections of VHF and malaria are prevalent in Tanzania and affect more the older than the younger 
population. Since the overlapping symptoms in co-infected individuals may challenge accurate diagnosis, adequate 
laboratory diagnosis should be emphasized in the management of febrile illnesses.

Background
Viral haemorrhagic fevers (VHF) have become more 
prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa during recent years, 
causing either sporadic or large-scale epidemics, thus 
posing significant risk to public health. The VHFs 
reported in sub-Saharan Africa in recent years include

Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF), Ebola virus 
disease (EVD), Lassa fever (LF), Marburg virus disease 
(MVD), Rift Valley fever (RVF), and yellow fever (YF) [1–
4]. On the other hand, malaria is among the most impor-
tant mosquito-borne parasitic endemic disease in the 
region, accounting for 94% of the reported cases glob-
ally [5]. VHFs and malaria are among the major causes 
of febrile illnesses in humans in sub-Saharan Africa. 
The fact that malaria prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa 
is high, it is likely that the prevalence of co-infections of 
VHFs and malaria to be common in the region.
Of the VHFs, RVF and CCHF outbreaks have been 
reported in Tanzania [6–8]. Although no clinical case of 
EVD, MVD or YF have been reported in Tanzania, its 
geographical position puts the country at high risk. This 
is due to the fact that outbreaks of the three diseases have 
been reported from its neighbouring countries [9–12]. 
Moreover, a recent study in Tanzania has reported the 
presence of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibod-
ies against to CCHF, EVD, MVD, RVF, and YF in 12.8% 
of the population across the country. The specific disease 
estimated seroprevalence of CCHF, EVD, MVD, RFV 
and YF was 2.0%, 3.4%, 1.2%, 4.8%, and 1.4%, respectively 
[4]. Tanzania is among the 10 countries with the highest 
malaria cases and deaths, accounting for 3% of the global 
cases and 5% of global deaths [5]. Malaria is endemic in 
almost all regions of Tanzania, with over 95% of the pop-
ulation at risk, though with significant transmission vari-
ations between and within districts [13, 14]. The disease 
accounts for about a quarter and a third of all outpatient 
attendances and hospital admissions, respectively, and is 
the leading cause of hospital mortality [15].
In sub-Saharan Africa, VHF and malaria co-infections 
have been reported in Gabon [16], Senegal [17], Nigeria 
[18], and Democratic Republic of the Congo [19]. In a 
recent systematic review, prevalence of EVD and malaria 
co-infection was reported to be between 19 and 72% [20]. 
Co-infections of malaria and VHF have been described 
to shape and influence the development of inflammatory 
diseases, with either beneficial or detrimental outcomes 
[20–22]. A study in Liberia has indicated that malaria 
parasitaemia was associated with an increase in the prob-
ability of surviving EVD infection [23]. In the contrary, 
in a study in Sierra Leone, the mortality risk was highest 
among patients with both EVD and malaria than those 
with EVD alone [24].
Most VHFs and malaria initially present with simi-
lar non-specific symptoms and signs of fever, headache, 
joint pains and weaknesses, posing challenges in differen-
tial diagnosis [19, 25]. Clinical diagnosis of VHF is con-
sidered when a patient is from an endemic area, tested 
malaria negative, and an alternative diagnosis cannot be 
established. When not systematically investigated, VHFs 
are often misdiagnosed as malaria due to similar clini-
cal presentations; thus delays the identification of VHF 
outbreaks and the associated potentially high morbid-
ity and mortality [20]. There is dearth of information 
on VHF and malaria co-infections in Tanzania and pos-
sibly underreported because of the limited number of 
laboratories capable of diagnosing VHF infections. The 
objective of this study was therefore to determine the 
prevalence of co-infections of VHFs and malaria among 
febrile patients seeking health care in Tanzania.
Methods
Study areas and design
This study was carried out in eight districts in five dis-
tinct ecological zones of Tanzania. The zones are West-
ern, Southern-highlands, North-eastern, Central and 
Lake Victoria. The western zone is characterised by tropi-
cal forest, unimodal rainfall pattern, and an altitude of 
2300  m. The Southern-highlands zone covers regions 
with high precipitations, tropical forest, bimodal rainfall 
pattern, low temperatures and elevation > 2300  m. The 
North-eastern Tanzania is characterised by a bimodal 
rainfall pattern and seasons of high temperatures. The 
Central zone comprises of a semi-arid area at an eleva-
tion of about 1000 m characterized by moderate precipi-
tation and unimodal rainfall pattern. The Lake Victoria 
area is characterized by a bimodal rainfall pattern and 
intermediate temperatures and an elevation of 1134  m. 
The study districts were Buhigwe, Kalambo (western), 
Kyela (southern-highlands), Kilindi, Kinondoni (north-
eastern), Kondoa, Mvomero (central) and Ukerewe (Lake 
Victoria) (Fig. 1). The study area has been described in 
detail elsewhere [4].
In each district, a hospital and two health centres were 
conveniently selected while a random sampling was done 
in selecting four dispensaries. Patients presenting with 
fever were recruited for the study. Fever was defined as 
any patient with an axillary temperature of  > 38 ℃ based 
on clinical thermometer reading on the day of health 
facility visit. Clinicians from the study team and those 
from the selected health facilities carried out clinical 
assessment for each participant. Socio-demographic 
and epidemiological data were collected from each 
participant.
Sample size calculation
To calculate the sample size for this study, the fever 
prevalence of 25% [13], a desired absolute precision of 
5%, and a confidence level of 95% were used [26]. The 
minimum estimated sample size was 289 individuals. To 
split among the districts, the population-weighted sam-
ples based on the zonal and regional prevalence of the 
febrile population were used [13]. District specific sample

sizes were as follows: Western zone: Buhigwe = 33; Kal-
ambo = 31; Southern-highlands zone (Kyela) = 48; North-
eastern zone: (Kilindi = 31; Kinondoni = 39); Central 
zone: (Kondoa = 32; Mvomero = 49); and Lake Victoria 
zone: Ukerewe = 45. The sample size considered a con-
tingency of 10% to account for non-response, refusal, or 
missingness. The district sample was split equally among 
the study facilities.
Data collection
This facility-based study was conducted between June 
and November 2018. The research team was oriented 
on the study objectives, procedures, research ethics 
and trained on data collection tools. All febrile patients 
attending healthcare facility were targeted. A face-to-
face interview was conducted to collect information on 
socio-demographic and clinical characteristics using 
a semi-structured questionnaire programmed in the 
AfyaData app installed in smartphones [27]. The socio-
demographic characteristics collected included age, sex, 
occupation, village, workplace, and area of residence. 
Each individual was examined for symptoms and/or 
clinical features of headache, rash, fatigue, muscle pain, 
bone pain, back or joint pain, nausea, abdominal pain, 
bruising, vomiting, red spots (on the skin/eye/mucosa), 
and jaundice. Each participant was assigned a code that

restricted her/his direct identification. Axillary tempera-
ture was recorded using a digital clinical thermometer. 
Five millilitres of blood were collected from adults and 
children > 10 years and 2 ml from children < 10 years of 
age by venepuncture using standard sterile technique. 
Malaria infection was tested using malaria rapid diagnos-
tic tests (CareStart™ malaria HRP-2/pLDH, American 
Access Bio Company, USA). The sensitivity and specific-
ity of CareStart™ malaria HRP2/pLDH (Pf/pan) combo 
test are high [28] and test has been approved for diagno-
sis of malaria at the point of care in Tanzania.
Sera were harvested from the collected blood sam-
ples by centrifugation at the laboratories in the respec-
tive district hospitals. The samples were labelled using 
a unique identification number, archived, and stored in 
liquid nitrogen (−  196  ℃) before being transported to 
the laboratory at Sokoine University of Agriculture in 
Morogoro, Tanzania, where they were stored at −80 ℃ 
until examination. Aliquots of the sera were tested for the 
presence of human IgM antibodies against CCHF, EVD, 
LF, MBV, RVF, and YF using commercial enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assays (ELISA) kits (My BioSource, Inc., 
San Diego, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions. To validate the ELISA, determination of the 
intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV), inter-assay CV, 
recovery, linearity and parallelism was performed. The 
intra-assay CV (%) and inter-assay CV (%) were less than 
15% for reactive samples.
Data analysis
Data were analysed using Statistical Package for the 
Social Sciences (SPSS) Statistics version 23 (IBM, 
Armonk, NY, USA). Frequencies, median, and associ-
ated interquartile ranges (IQRs) were calculated. The 
Chi-square test (or Fisher’s exact test where appropri-
ate) was used to compare the proportions of positive 
malaria, VHF and co-infections frequency by sex and 
age. A statistically significant difference was consid-
ered when the P-value was below 0.05. Cut-off values 
for ELISA antibody analysis were determined following 
the manufacturer’s instructions. The assay performance 
was considered adequate when the intra- and inter-assay 
coefficient of variabilities were less than 15%.
Results
Socio‑demographic and clinical characteristics
A total of 308 participants were involved in the study. Of 
these, 185 (60.1%) were females, and 123 (39.9%) males. 
The mean age was 35 ± 19  years. Over half (54.2%) of 
participants were in the 16‒45 years age category. About 
two-thirds (62.3%) of participants had primary school 
education. Crop farmers accounted for the largest pro-
portion (43.2%) of the participants (Table 1).
The most common symptoms among the study partici-
pants were body aches and pains which included head-
ache (48.4%), muscle, bone, back, or joint pain (32.0%), 
and stomach pain (16.4%). The least observed signs were 
jaundice, bleeding/bruising, and red spots on the skin, 
eyes or mucosae (Table 1).
Seroprevalence of malaria or viral haemorrhagic fevers
Of the 308 febrile individuals, 54 (17.5%) were posi-
tive to the rapid diagnostic malaria test. The prevalence 
of malaria infection was higher among females (10.1%; 
n = 31) than males (7.5%; n = 23). Individuals aged 
0‒15 years (6.8%; n = 21) were most affected by malaria. 
However, there was no significant difference between 
sex and the age groups (P > 0.05) (Table  2). A total of 
15 (4.8%) participants were positive for IgM antibod-
ies against VHF tested (RVF = 8; CCHF = 2; EBV = 3; 
MBV = 1; YF = 1). None of the samples was positive for 
Lassa fever virus antibody. There was a significant differ-
ence between the age groups among seropositive indi-
viduals to EVD (P < 0.05). Seroprevalence of RVF, CCHF, 
MVD and YF were similar in all age groups (Table 2).
VHFs and malaria co‑infections
Six (1.9%) individuals had both VHF (RVF = 2; CCHF = 1; 
EVD = 2; MVD = 1) and malaria infections. Of those 
with VHF and malaria co-infections, four (66.7%) were 
males and two (33.3%) were females. In relation to age, 
the highest co-infection rate (0.6%), was observed among 
individuals aged 46–60 years (P < 0.05). Location was sig-
nificantly associated with co-infection (P < 0.05) as higher 
prevalence was recorded among those from Buhigwe 
(1.2%) followed by Kinondoni (0.9%) districts (Table 3).
Severe headache was the most frequent (100%) com-
plain among those with both VHF and malaria infections. 
Other aches, including muscle, bone, back, and joint 
pains were reported by 83.3% of those with co-infections 
of VHFs and malaria (Table 4).
Discussion
Malaria was the most important febrile associated 
infection in the study districts. Overall, about 5% of 
the study population were positive for IgM antibodies 
against VHF tested, with RVF accounting for the largest 
proportion of the infections. Co-infections of malaria 
and VHFs were detected in about 2% of the febrile indi-
viduals seeking care from health facilities. While RVF 
outbreaks have been reported to occur in low malaria 
endemic districts of Tanzania [29–32], CCHF has been 
reported in high malaria area of the country [6, 7]; thus 
allowing the occurrence of mixed infections in patients 
as previously reported in other endemic regions [33]. 
The prevalence of malaria infections in the current 
Page 5 of 8

study was lower than that reported by other recent 
studies in Tanzania [13, 14, 33]. This could be due to 
the differences in the study period, targeted population 
and also biases of health-facility based surveys. A rela-
tively higher prevalence of co-infection of malaria and 
EVD has been reported from studies during outbreaks 
in Democratic Republic of the Congo [19] and Sierra 
Leone [25]. Similar to the findings of a study in Nigeria 
[34], no malaria and YF co-infection was  observed in 
this study.

The VHF and malaria co-infection rate observed in 
this study was associated with older age. The higher 
prevalence of VHF and malaria co-infections among the 
adults is likely to be associated with higher exposure 
compared with children due to their livelihoods activities 
that bring them closer to sources of VHF infection [35]. 
Many studies have linked VHF and malaria co-infections 
with increased human activity around ecological zones of 
increasing biodiversity, climate change, negative health-
care-seeking practices of some community members, 
gate-keeping role by traditional healers and traditional 
health care system, water and sanitation challenges, bur-
ial practices, and corpse management capacity in poor-
resource settings [22, 25, 36, 37].
VHFs (EVD, MVD, RVF) and malaria co-infections 
were most prevalent in Buhigwe district in Kigoma 
Region of western Tanzania, bordering the Demo-
cratic Republic of Congo. Available statistics indicate 
that Buhigwe is among the districts with high malaria 
prevalence (24%) in Tanzania [14, 38]. Moreover, a 
recent seroprevalence study has reported a 4.4% over-
all prevalence of VHF in the same district, the high-
est rate reported in Tanzania [4]. Co-infections due 
to malaria and either RVF or CCHF were most preva-
lent in Kinondoni district. The district is within the 
high malaria burden region [38] and a recent study has 
reported an overall prevalence of VHF of 2.8% [4].
Aches and pains including severe headache were sig-
nificantly noted in most of all the co-infected patients in 
this study compared to patients with VHF alone. How-
ever, this study could not determine whether malaria, 
VHF or both to be responsible for the observed symp-
toms. Our study agrees with others that patients with 
VHFs usually present with non-specific signs, including 
fever, vomiting, diarrhoea, fatigue, myalgia and head-
ache [19]. Most often, later on, if not self-recovered, 
the disease progresses to rashes and some affected 
individuals will show evidence of coagulation disorders 
with multiple foci of mucosal haemorrhage and persis-
tent bleeding, while massive haemorrhages usually only 
occur in fatal cases [39]. Our study observed an over-
lap presentation of fever, headache, muscle/bone/back/
joint pain, and vomiting in all patients co-infected with 
VHF and malaria.
The presence of antibodies against RVF, CCHF, EVD, 
MVD and malaria in this study was highly unexpected. 
The results are alarming because if sublethal VHF 
infections commonly occur, they are likely to be missed 
in co-infections with malaria.
This study has limitations including use of rapid 
test to diagnose malaria, which could result to some 
cases been missed due to low parasitaemia. In addi-
tion, no information on the use of antimalarials prior 
to the test was obtained which could result to false 
positives. The study was conducted between June and 
November, a period associated with both high and low 
malaria season depending on the district, which could 
influence visits to health facilities and availability of 
febrile patients as treatment seeking is low during low 
malaria seasons, and levels of malaria risk obtained. 
The serological results are based on antibody detec-
tion which are likely to be a reflection of cumulative

exposure and/or antibody persistence following sin-
gle or multiple exposure. Moreover, point of care tests 
also have limitations associated with possibility that 
one or more as-yet-unknown pathogens are circulating 
among the human populations sampled in this study, 
producing antibodies cross-reactive. The results of this 
study should be interpreted with caution. Despite use-
ful information gathered on the presence of VHF and 
malaria co-infections, the findings from this study are 
based on very small sample hence weaken the accuracy 
and may not be representative.
Conclusions
The findings of this study show that the prevalence of 
co-infections of viral haemorrhagic fevers and malaria 
in Tanzania is generally low, though higher rates were 
observed among the older  individuals. Since infections 
due to malaria and VHF are associated with similar 
symptoms, these findings suggest the need for improve-
ment in case management of febrile illnesses based on 
adequate laboratory diagnosis. It is equally important 
that more studies are needed to establish how VHFs and 
malaria infections interact to improve case management 
and control in the future. The findings also highlight the 
need to conduct molecular studies to identify specific 
pathogens.
