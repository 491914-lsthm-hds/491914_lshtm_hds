In September 2014, a single fatal case of Marburg virus 
was identified in a healthcare worker in Kampala, Uganda. 
The source of infection was not identified, and no second­
ary cases were identified. We describe the rapid identifica­
tion, laboratory diagnosis, and case investigation of the third 
Marburg virus outbreak in Uganda.
M
arburg virus disease (MVD) is caused by Marburg vi­
rus (MARV; family Filoviridae, which also includes 
Ebola viruses). The disease was first discovered in 1967 in 
Marburg and Frankfurt, Germany, after laboratory work­
ers were infected from monkeys imported from Uganda 
(1). Thereafter, sporadic cases and outbreaks of MVD have 
been documented in South Africa, Kenya, the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo, Angola, Uganda, the Netherlands, 
and the United States (2). MVD remains of great public 
health importance because of the case-fatality rate, which 
can be as high as 90%, and documented human-to-human 
transmission, with associated socioeconomic consequences.
Uganda has experienced previous outbreaks of MVD, 
resulting in fatalities and socioeconomic effects from loss 
of tourism. The first recorded outbreak in Uganda occurred 
in the Kamwenge district in 2007, where 4 MVD cases 
were confirmed in miners at the Kitaka mine (3). A second, 
larger outbreak occurred in the western Uganda districts of 
Kabale, Ibanda, and Kamwenge in 2012 (4) and was also 
linked to mining activity in the Ibanda district. In addi­
tion, tourists from the United States and the Netherlands 
were infected with MARV in western Uganda when they 

visited Python Cave in Queen Elizabeth National Park in 
2008 (5,6). Both Python Cave and the Kitaka mine are in­
habited by Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus), the 
host reservoir of MARV (7).
In 2014, a fatal case of MVD occurred in Uganda. We 
report here on the field and laboratory investigation of this 
case, including possible sources of infection.
The Study
On September 23, 2014, a healthcare worker was admitted 
to Mengo Hospital in Kampala, Uganda, with a febrile ill­
ness suspected to be viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) infec­
tion. The patient, a 30-year-old man, was a radiographer who 
worked at Mengo Hospital and part-time at Mpigi Health 
Center IV in the Mpigi district, ≈30 km south of Kampala 
(Figure 1). His symptoms began on September 17, 2014. A 
rapid diagnostic test result was positive for malaria, and the 
patient was given intravenous ceftriaxone, 5% dextrose, and 
artesunate. However, his condition continued to deteriorate. 
On September 26, he began to display hemorrhagic 
signs, notably profuse bleeding from body orifices. Clini­
cal findings included fever (temperature 38.4°C), nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, musculoskeletal pain, abdominal pain, 
headache, sore throat, difficulty swallowing, difficulty 
breathing, anorexia, bleeding from the nose, bloody stools, 
vomiting blood, and upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding. 
He died on September 28.
Whole blood and serum samples collected on Septem­
ber 28 were sent to the Uganda Virus Research Institute 
(UVRI)/US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) VHF laboratory in Entebbe for testing on Septem­
ber 30. We performed diagnostic testing by real-time re­
verse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), antigen detection, and 
MARV IgM ELISA on the suspected sample as described 
(8). We detected MARV by RT-PCR, but antigen detection 
and IgM serologic results were negative.
We obtained independent confirmation from duplicate 
whole blood and serum samples by using RT-PCR primers 
and probes targeting MARV VP40 gene and a commercial 
filovirus PCR screening assay (Altona Diagnostics, Ham­
burg, Germany) (9) (Table). On the basis of the positive 
RT-PCR results, we confirmed MVD in this patient. We 
shipped specimens to the CDC Viral Special Pathogens 
Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pa­
thology, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic In­
fectious Diseases (Atlanta, GA, USA), for further testing, 
including virus isolation and sequencing. A virus isolate

single passage in cell culture (Vero E6).
After laboratory confirmation, a multidisciplinary 
team from UVRI and CDC-Uganda performed the ini­
tial outbreak investigations at Mengo Hospital and Mpigi 
Health Center IV. The investigation team provided the out­
break case definition, and details of case contacts were ob­
tained from both health facilities. An investigation was also 
performed in Kasese District, where the health worker was 
taken for burial. In addition, an ecologic investigation was 
conducted to identify roosting sites nearby for the potential 
presence of R. aegyptiacus bats.
We created an outbreak database using the Epi Info 
Viral Hemorrhagic Fever outbreak management appli­
cation (10). All case and contact data were managed by 
the Uganda Ministry of Health Public Health Emergency 
Operations Center. We identified 197 close contacts, who 
were followed for 21 days. During the course of follow-
up, 33 (16.2%) of the 197 contacts converted to suspected 
case-patients by exhibiting clinically compatible signs or 
symptoms matching the outbreak case definition. Blood 
samples from suspected case-patients were tested at the 
UVRI/CDC laboratory in Entebbe; all were negative for 
MARV by RT-PCR and serologic analysis.

Marburg Virus Disease, Kampala, Uganda
Conclusions
We describe the second single-case filovirus outbreak de­
tected in Uganda; a case of infection with Sudan ebola­
virus was reported in Luwero District in 2011 (11). The 
investigation was unable to identify a conclusive source of 
infection, including evidence of the natural reservoir host 
near where the infected patient was working or residing or 
potential cases in persons who visited health centers before 
this case was confirmed. No secondary cases arose from 
contact with the initial case-patient. 
The patient tested positive for malaria but later tested 
positive for MARV by RT-PCR and serologic analysis. 
These findings indicate that co-infection of viral hemorrhag­
ic fever (VHF) and other tropical infectious diseases can 
confound diagnosis and delay early detection, potentially 
resulting in large outbreaks that are much harder to control, 
as was seen during the 2014–2015 Ebola virus outbreak in 
West Africa (12). This finding emphasizes the need for con­
tinued surveillance and awareness even when other, more 
common pathogens are initially suspected.
The finding of no secondary cases in this investigation 
can be attributed, in part, to use of infection control prac­
tices and personal protective equipment when first encoun­
tering a suspected VHF case. Because Uganda has experi­
enced 10 VHF outbreaks since 2011, increased awareness 
and use of personal protective equipment and infection 
control practices have greatly limited secondary transmis­
sion, especially in the healthcare setting. Routine use of 
gloves, protective gowns, and chlorine is now more com­
mon in lower-level healthcare facilities in Uganda; these

Figure 2. Phylogenetic tree comparing complete or nearly 
complete Marburg virus (MARV) genomes sequenced from 
bat and human sources in Uganda. A consensus whole-
genome sequence was assembled by mapping reads to the 
reference MARV sequence NC_001608 using CLC Genomics 
Workbench (Waltham, MA, USA). A phylogenetic tree was 
constructed using MEGA6.06 (http://www.megasoftware.net). 
Viral sequences acquired from human sources are in standard 
type, and viral sequences acquired from bats are italicized; 
the sequence from the human case-patient described in this 
study, MBG 812601 2014, is in bold. Evolutionary history was 
inferred using the maximum-likelihood method based on the 
Tamura-Nei model with MEGA6.06. The tree is drawn to scale, 
with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions 
per site. Values at nodes represent bootstrap values following 
1,000 replicates. Scale bar represents substitutions per site. 
GenBank accession numbers used in this tree are KP985768,

Mpigi Health Center IV.
The full genomic sequence of this MARV isolate 
(812601; Genbank accession no. KP985768) falls into a 
cluster that consists mostly of MARV sequences isolat­
ed from bats. The closest related sequence was obtained 
from MARV isolated from a juvenile male R. aegyptia­
cus bat (Q843) captured in August 2009 in Python Cave, 
Queen Elizabeth National Park (Figure 2). Other viral se­
quences from bat specimens in this clade were from bats 
collected from either Python Cave or the Kitaka mine dur­
ing 2007–2009. The most closely related human sequence 
(01Uga07) was from a miner who worked in the Kitaka 
mine in July 2007 (3,7). Because of the wide genetic di­
versity of MARVs, there is no definitive way to identify 
where this patient may have become infected.
We do not know why the patient did not transmit 
MARV to any of his close contacts. We can assume that 
none of the contacts had substantial exposure to the patient 
while he was infectious. The relatively small size of this 
and previous filovirus outbreaks in Uganda can be attribut­
ed to enhanced VHF surveillance, rapid case identification, 
laboratory testing, and investments from the global health 
security agenda in rapid sample transportation to the na­
tional VHF reference laboratory for diagnostic testing (13). 
VHF surveillance continues to be a top priority for Uganda, 
and the VHF surveillance program continues to play a cru­
cial role in detecting, responding to, and helping to control 
these outbreaks.
