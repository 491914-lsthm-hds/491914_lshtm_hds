Abstract
Background: Sub-Saharan Africa is home to a variety of pathogens, but disease surveillance and the
healthcare infrastructure necessary for proper management and control are severely limited. Lassa virus, the
cause of Lassa fever, a severe hemorrhagic fever in humans is endemic in West Africa. In Sierra Leone at the
Kenema Government Hospital Lassa Diagnostic Laboratory, up to 70 % of acute patient samples suspected of
Lassa fever test negative for Lassa virus infection. This large amount of acute undiagnosed febrile illness can
be attributed in part to an array of hemorrhagic fever and arthropod-borne viruses causing disease that goes
undetected and untreated.
Methods: To better define the nature and extent of viral pathogens infecting the Sierra Leonean population,
we developed a multiplexed MAGPIX® assay to detect IgG antibodies against Lassa, Ebola, Marburg, Rift Valley
fever, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses as well as pan-assays for flaviviruses and alphaviruses.
This assay was used to survey 675 human serum samples submitted to the Lassa Diagnostic Laboratory
between 2007 and 2014.
Results: In the study population, 50.2 % were positive for Lassa virus, 5.2 % for Ebola virus, 10.7 % for
Marburg virus, 1.8 % for Rift Valley fever virus, 2.0 % for Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, 52.9 %
for flaviviruses and 55.8 % for alphaviruses.
Conclusions: These data exemplify the importance of disease surveillance and differential diagnosis for viral
diseases in Sierra Leone. We demonstrate the endemic nature of some of these viral pathogens in the region
and suggest that unrecognized outbreaks of viral infection have occurred.

Background
Sierra Leone is plagued by a large array of human
diseases, but insufficient healthcare infrastructure has
resulted in many being unrecognized and uncontrolled.
Diseases are often only reported as outbreaks and epi-
demics, despite their consistent presence in the commu-
nity. A notable exception is Lassa virus (LASV), which is
endemic to Sierra Leone and neighboring countries, and
causes Lassa fever (LF), a severe viral hemorrhagic fever
that can have a case fatality rate as high as 69 % [1–4].
In eastern Sierra Leone, Kenema Government Hospital
(KGH)
has
a
designated
LF
ward
where
patients
suspected of LASV infection can be isolated and treated.
The Lassa Diagnostic Laboratory supports the ward and
regional medical facilities and receives approximately
500–700 suspected LF samples annually [1, 5]. Of the
submitted samples, only 30–40 % can be attributed to
LASV infection, indicating significant disease resulting
from other unidentified pathogens. Studies on acute
undiagnosed samples from KGH found evidence of
hemorrhagic fever and arthropod-borne virus infections
including Ebola virus (EBOV), Marburg virus (MARV),
Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), yellow fever virus (YFV),

gunya virus (CHIKV), and O'nyong-nyong virus (ONNV)
[5, 6], however the disease burden on the human popula-
tion is unknown. To better define the virus infections over
time we undertook a seroprevalence survey of 675 human
samples collected at the KGH Lassa Diagnostic Labora-
tory from suspected LF patients between 2007 and 2014
to detect immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against an
array of hemorrhagic fever and arthropod-borne viruses.
Utilizing a multiplex assay on the magnetic bead-based
MAGPIX® system (Luminex, Austin, TX), we previously
demonstrated increased sensitivity of the MAGPIX® detec-
tion platform over enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays
(ELISA) for both LASV and EBOV antigen and antibody
detection (Satterly et al., submitted). Here, we use the
MAGPIX® system to detect and identify virus-specific IgG
antibodies against LASV, EBOV, MARV, RVFV, Crimean
Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), and pan-assays
for flaviviruses and alphaviruses, in an attempt to better
define the disease burden on the population over time.
Methods
Human samples
The Lassa Diagnostic Laboratory receives blood samples
from suspected LF patients and their contacts primarily
from Sierra Leone, with occasional samples from Liberia
and Guinea. A total of 675 serum samples from sus-
pected LF patients and contacts collected between 2007
and 2014 were tested for IgG antibodies at the Lassa
Diagnostic
Laboratory
and
the
Diagnostic
Systems
Division at USAMRIID. Whole blood samples were
centrifuged at 200xg, serum collected, and stored at -80 °C
until testing. Research on human subjects was con-
ducted in compliance with US Department of Defense,
federal and state regulations. All data were gathered
and human subject research was conducted under an
USAMRIID institutional review board protocol (no. HP-
09-32).
Viral antigen
Viruses used for production of MAGPIX® antigenic
materials included LASV Josiah [7, 8]; EBOV Mayinga
[9]; MARV Musoke [10]; RVFV ZH 501 strain [11];
CCHFV IbAr10200 [12]; DENV-2 New Guinea C [13, 14];
WNV NY99 [15]; YFV 17D [16]; and CHIKV B8635.
All viruses were propagated at the appropriate biological
safety level (BSL), either BSL-3 or BSL-4. Briefly, the
viruses were grown in appropriate continuous cell lines
until cytopathic effects were observed in 50 to 75 %
of the cells. Tissue culture supernatants (TCS) were clari-
fied by centrifugation, inactivated by treatment with
0.3 % beta-propiolactone, aliquoted, and stored at -70 °C.
Virus infected TCS was inactivated by gamma-irradiation
(3 x 106 rads) and safety tested to ensure inactivation.
Optimal dilutions of antigens were determined by checker-
board titrations against virus specific antibodies. Mock
TCS antigens used as negative controls were prepared
as described above using uninfected cell monolayers.
MAGPIX® assay development
To develop a multiplexed IgG detection assay, we first
chose monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) based on target
specificity and exclusivity. In the case of the pan-assays,
we considered inclusivity of multiple virus family mem-
bers. Initial antibody selection was based on ELISA
checkerboard assessments with the viruses of interest.
MAbs with strong affinity for their target were coupled
to MAGPIX® magnetic microspheres at a concentration
of 4 μg antibody/1 X 106 beads using the Luminex Anti-
body Coupling Kit (catalog #4050016) according to
manufacturer’s instructions. They were then optimized
for MAGPIX® IgG detection, and tested for exclusivity
against the additional viral targets. Pan-assays utilized
MAbs with the greatest cross-reactivity to the virus
family. MAbs coupled to MAGPIX® microspheres and
used in MAGPIX® IgG detection assays were as follows:
anti-LASV glycoprotein complex (GP) L52-85-6-BG12;
anti-LASV nucleoprotein (NP) L52-2159-15; anti-EBOV
glycoprotein (GP) Z-DA06-AH05; anti-EBOV viral protein
40 (VP40) M-HD6-A10A; anti-MARV VP40 3MI2; anti-
RVFV nucleocapsid (NC) R1-P6F6-6-2-2; anti-CCHFV
nucleocapsid (N) CCII 12G10-2-2A; anti-YFV envelope
(E) YF-211-4E11 (pan-flavivirus capture capable of detec-
ting IgG antibodies to DENV, WNV, YFV, Japanese
encephalitis virus (JEV), and tick-borne encephalitis virus
(TBEV)) ([17], unpublished data); and anti- Sindbis virus
(SINV)/Semliki forest virus glycoprotein E1 (E1) SLK42
(pan-alphavirus capture capable of detecting IgG anti-
bodies SINV, CHIKV, ONNV, Venezuelan equine ence-
phalitis virus (VEEV), Western equine encephalitis virus
(WEEV), and Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV)
([18], unpublished data). Virus-specific sets of micro-
spheres were combined into a multiplex assay that could
detect several targets in a single sample well for IgG
detection.
MAGPIX® IgG detection
Nine distinct assays detecting IgG antibodies against
LASV-GP, LASV-NP, EBOV-GP, EBOV-VP40, MARV-
VP40, RVFV-NC, CCHFV-N, YFV-E (pan-flavivirus),
and SINV-E1 (pan-alphavirus) were combined in a mul-
tiplexed IgG detection assay used to test the 675 human
sera samples. Microspheres, 2000 of each of the nine
sets, were combined into all wells of 96-well plates;
to which either mock TCS or a mixture of viral infected
TCS was added. The plates were covered, incubated
at room temperature (RT) for 1 h with shaking at
400–500 rpm, and washed three times using a magnetic

plate separator. Patient serum was diluted 1:100 and
added to wells in triplicate. The plates were covered and
incubated at room temperature for 1 h with shaking. The
plates were washed, and anti-human IgG-R-Phycoerythrin
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was added at a 1:100 dilution. The
plates were covered, incubated at room temperature for
30 min, washed, and read on a MAGPIX® instrument. The
median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of each bead set in
each well was obtained. Throughout the assay, the total
volume for each step was 50 μl. All dilutions and washes
were with 100 μl phosphate-buffered saline with 0.02 %
Tween-20.
Statistical analysis of MAGPIX® results
Assay results were log transformed prior to analysis. For
each sample, the z-score was calculated by the mean
difference between the log transformed sample replicates
in viral infected TCS and the log transformed sample
replicates in uninfected TCS, divided by the standard
error of the difference. The MFI variance on the log
scale was found to be homogenous within each test,
and an appropriate pooled variance estimate was taken
across each test in calculating standard errors. Results
from multiple tests were collected from a single well, and
the data for each test were analyzed separately. This ana-
lysis step was carried out with a generalized linear model
having identity link and normal distribution, as provided
in the SAS® GENMOD procedure [19]. Results that had a
conservative z-score of at least three standard errors above
zero were considered a positive test. Samples testing posi-
tive for one or more targets of a single virus was consi-
dered positive for the virus; for example, if a sample tested
positive for LASV-NP and negative for LASV-GP, it was
considered positive for LASV. Prevalence was calculated
using the dichotomization obtained at the three standard
errors cut point. Although 675 serum samples were
assayed, test results with readings from less than ten
beads per well were considered unreliable and therefore
excluded from analysis; therefore, the total number of
samples analyzed for each test varied.
Results
Prevalence of anti-viral IgG antibodies
A total of 675 serum samples submitted to the Lassa
Diagnostic Laboratory in Kenema, Sierra Leone were
subjected to serological testing. Samples were tested for
IgG antibodies to specific viral targets and results are pre-
sented in Table 1. Of the data collected, 50.2 % (n = 328)
of samples had detectable antibodies to LASV, consistent
with previous estimates of 8–52 % in the area [20].
Antibodies against EBOV were detected in 5.2 % (n = 35)
of the sample population, MARV in 10.7 % (n = 71), RVFV
in 1.8 % (n = 12), and CCHFV in 2.0 % (n = 13). Detectable
antibodies to one or more flaviviruses were demonstrated
in 52.9 % (n = 330) of the samples, and 55.8 % (n = 373)
had detectable antibodies to one or more alphaviruses. Of
the seven distinct viruses (including the two pan-assays),
the mean number of positive tests was 1.8, with 26.2 % of
individuals testing positive for 3 or more distinct viruses,
as shown in Table 2. A more accurate number is likely
higher, considering the pan-alphavirus and pan-flavivirus
tests detect multiple exposures.
Longitudinal assessment of prevalence
A longitudinal assessment to investigate chronological
trends in positive IgG antibody rates was performed and
presented in Table 3. Surprisingly, MARV antibodies
were detected in 23 % of samples tested from 2008,
suggesting a possible unrecognized outbreak of the virus
in the area. Of additional note is the large increase in
RVFV in 2014, and the fluctuations in alphavirus positive

Discussion
Knowledge of the diseases circulating in a region is para-
mount for proper diagnosis, care and treatment of
patients, and ultimately a reduction of overall disease
burden. Sierra Leone and the surrounding areas suffer
from numerous viral diseases, but surveillance and diag-
nostic capabilities fall short of the need for effective
disease control. Moreover, as demonstrated by the recent
EBOV outbreak in West Africa, differential diagnosis
among febrile illnesses and knowledge of their prevalence
is of great importance for timely and efficient manage-
ment of patients and outbreak prevention. To more accu-
rately define the disease burden on the population, we
applied a multiplexed serological assay to screen a panel
of 675 serum samples from Sierra Leone to identify some
of the arthropod-borne and hemorrhagic fever viral burden
in the region.
The MAGPIX platform, a multiplexed, bead-based
system, can efficiently collect valuable disease burden
information
where
it
is
not
routinely
monitored.
Customization and optimization of multiple assays in a
single well permitted testing for each target of interest
in less time and with less effort than other methods
such as ELISA. In our study population, 26.2 % were
positive for exposure to at least three viruses. Since
we investigated only IgG antibodies, the results repre-
sented the infection of individuals over their lifetimes and
not a single point in time, therefore it was expected to
find antibodies to multiple targets in a single individual.
This further highlights the severe extent of public health
risk of virus infection for the population.
Among suspected LF patients we found LASV sero-
prevalence to be 50.2 %, which is consistent with esti-
mates ranging from 8–52 % throughout the country and
the hyper-endemic region in eastern Sierra Leone, where
KGH is located [20]. EBOV and MARV seroprevalence
were 5.2 % and 10.7 %, respectively. A recent study esti-
mated seroprevalence of filoviruses to be 22 % in the
area, and an IgM survey from the same hospital reported
a 9 % acute EBOV infection rate between 2006 and 2008
[5, 6]. Considering the estimated fatality rates of EBOV
and that we are observing latent immunity only present
in survivors, the 5.2 % prevalence seen here correlates
appropriately with the 9 % observed acute cases during
the time period of sample collection. In our study,
EBOV infections were demonstrated in the population
as early as 2008 and earlier by others [5], indicating
circulating virus throughout the time period that may be
the result of a reservoir maintaining EBOV in the envi-
ronment. We found the overall seroprevalence of MARV
to be 10.7 % and present as early as 2007; although there
are no records of MARV outbreaks or disease in this
region, it was found retrospectively in 3.6 % of acute
samples from KGH dating from 2006–2008, suggesting
an increase in exposures occurred in the last 7 years.
There is a notable jump in MARV to 23 % seropre-
valence in 2008, suggesting a possible unrecognized out-
break of the MARV in the area. Since no increase in
VHF was noted, it might be that the MARV circulating
is a less virulent strain.
RVFV is a bunyavirus known to circulate throughout
sub-Saharan Africa, mainly among livestock and Aedes
species mosquitos, with sporadic outbreaks of human
disease. While the climate and epizootic factors are well
studied in East and South Africa, it has been postulated
that there are other factors supporting endemic sustai-
nability in West Africa [21–23]. Here we report a sero-
prevalence of 1.8 %, and observed a notable increase in
prevalence from 1–3 % in 2007–2013 to 11 % in 2014,
suggesting a substantial and recent increase in its circu-
lation. Another bunyavirus, CCHFV, is known to occur
throughout Africa, Asia and Europe in animals and ticks.
Human infection, albeit rare, is severe and usually asso-
ciated with livestock contact [24–27]. We detected low
numbers of CCHFV exposure (n = 13, 2.0 %) in our
sample population, even though it was not detected in
Table 3 Observed seropositive rates are reported in percent of total samples from that year for each pathogen. There was only one
representative sample from the year 2009, therefore statistics for that year are not included in the chart

other recent studies [5, 6]. The relatively low but consist-
ent prevalence of antibodies to RVFV and CCHFV may
suggest the presence of reservoirs or continual reintroduc-
tion to the region resulting in low, but consistent levels of
human infection.
Flaviviruses and alphaviruses cause a large number of
infections and disease throughout West Africa. Serological
data is difficult to interpret since there is significant cross-
reactivity among viruses within their respective families.
Generally, antibodies to a specific virus must be distin-
guished by plaque reduction neutralization tests. It is
known that multiple alphaviruses and flaviviruses circulate
in this region, some described and others possibly undis-
covered, but our interests were in the prevalence of
the overall disease attributed to each group. Therefore
given the number of samples tested here and the desire
for broad and complete surveillance, we developed two
pan-assays intended for the widest possible coverage of
flavivirus and alphavirus species. Antibody prevalence
rates were high for viruses of both families; combined
prevalence of flavivirus and alphavirus antibodies were
52.9 % and 55.8 %, respectively. There are limited data
on the seroprevalence to flaviviruses in Sierra Leone. A
survey by Boisen et al. (n = 77) from Kenema Government
Hospital revealed 45 % seroprevalence to DENV and 54 %
to WNV [6]. Studies in the neighboring countries of
Guinea, Nigeria, and Cameroon report a range of sero-
prevalence to flaviviruses including YFV (27–43 %),
DENV-2 (12–45 %) and WNV (7–49 %) [28–30], each of
which is detectable in our pan-assay and likely represent
significant portions of the overall seroprevalence. It is also
possible that YFV vaccination may have increased the
prevalence of flaviviruses recorded here; distribution of
the vaccine in Sierra Leone before and during the time
period of the samples examined here is estimated to have
a population coverage of 75 % or more [31, 32]. Similar to
the flaviviruses, there is limited information on the preva-
lence of alphavirus antibodies in Sierra Leone. Boisen
et al. reported in the same survey of 77 KGH serum sam-
ples a prevalence to CHIKV of 27 % [6]. The 55.8 % preva-
lence of alphavirus antibodies that we report here is
similar to estimates of CHIKV and ONNV in nearby
Cameroon where approximately 47 % of healthy adults
tested positive for CHIKV and/or ONNV (with noted
overlap) [30]. Our longitudinal data analysis revealed a
high prevalence of alphaviruses prior to 2010 (>60 %),
which may be in part due to ONNV and CHIKV out-
breaks known to occur in Guinea in 2003 [33] and 2006
[34]. Additionally, a spike in 2012 and a subsequent de-
crease in the following years correlates with a reported
CHIKV outbreak in Sierra Leone in 2012, identified in a
hospital only 60 kilometers from KGH [35]. The high rates
of both flaviviruses and alphaviruses seen here, combined
with identified recurring outbreaks of CHIKV and ONNV,
highlight the range of endemic viruses and their signifi-
cant impact on the limited medical infrastructure.
Retrospective studies have limitations by their very
nature. In this study the samples tested had a bias for
subjects that 1) were willing to seek help from the
hospital, and 2) had at some point presented with symp-
toms resembling LF. An individual’s presentation at the
hospital may indicate they are more likely to be exposed
to pathogens via factors in their lifestyle, geographic
location, or workplace environment.
Conclusions
The results of this study indicate that in addition to LASV,
there is a significant presence of filoviruses, bunyaviruses,
flaviviruses and alphaviruses actively circulating in the
Sierra Leone region over time. Some virus pathogens are
consistently circulating over the entire 7-year timespan
tested, which suggests many are endemic, being main-
tained in the region in natural reservoirs. We found indi-
cations of possible unrecognized outbreaks of infection or
subclinical exposure that add to the disease burden in the
human population. Sierra Leone and other regions where
the public health burden of these pathogens is insuffi-
ciently evaluated need improved pathogen surveillance.
Multiplexed and bead-based platforms such as MAGPIX
can provide an efficient, customizable surveillance method
to evaluate pathogen presence, spread and risk.
