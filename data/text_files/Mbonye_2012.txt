Abstract
Background: Since the year 2000, Uganda has experienced repeated outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHF). Ebola
VHF outbreak occurred in the districts of Gulu in 2000, Bundibugyo, 2007, Luwero, 2011, Kibaale in July 2012, Luwero in
November 2012. Marburg VHF was earlier reported in Ibanda in 2007. More recently in 2012, two outbreaks of Marburg
VHF have occurred in Ibanda and Kabale districts.
Objective: To present the epidemiological picture of the Marburg VHF recently reported in Ibanda and Kabale districts and
propose research questions to generate evidence to mitigate future epidemics.
Methods: A case definition for a VHF was developed. A frequency distribution of symptoms of confirmed and probable
cases was done. Descriptive analyses of reported cases using simple percentages, percent distributions and computation of
means was performed.
Results: The Marburg epidemic was reported in early September and by November 2012, a cumulative of 14 cases (9
confirmed and 5 probable) including 7 deaths had been registered, giving a case fatality rate (CFR) of 50%. A total of 202
contacts had been listed; out of which 193 had completed the 21-day follow-up period. The index case was a 33-year old
male, a teacher at Nyakatukura Secondary School in Ibanda district. He travelled to Ibanda from Kabale, his home district on
31st August 2012, reportedly healthy. He fell sick on 3rd September 2012 with complaints of fever, headache, loss of
appetite and general body weakness. Overall, the dominant symptoms for all cases were fever, vomiting, loss of appetite,
headache, abdominal pain, fatigue, diarrhea, and the least in occurrence was bleeding which accounted for 35.5% of all the
cases.
Conclusion: The source of infection for all the five Ebola Hemorrhagic fever outbreaks in Uganda and the recent Marburg
VHF outbreak in Ibanda and Kabale is not known. Currently there is suspicion that there could be an animal reservoir of
the Ebola and Marburg viruses from where occasional spillage into the human population occurs resulting in disease
outbreaks. This and other hypotheses require further investigation.

Background
Viral Haemorrhagic Fever (VHF) such as Ebola and
Marburg are caused by Filoviruses 1, 2, 3, 4 . There are
four Ebola virus sub types that are pathogenic and
naturally transmitted to humans, namely Ebola Zaire,
Ebola Sudan, Ebola Bundibugyo and Ebola Ivory
Coast. Since the year 2000, Uganda has documented
a total of five outbreaks, of these four outbreaks
were caused by Ebola Sudan and one outbreak of
Ebola Bundibugyo occurred in 2007. Ebola
outbreaks have occurred in the districts of Gulu
(2000), Bundibugyo (2007), Luwero (2011)5 and two
outbreaks have occurred in the districts of Kibaale
in July and Luwero in November this year 6-14 .
Two outbreaks of  Marburg viral
haemorrhagic fever have occurred in Uganda, the
first in Ibanda (2007) and recently in Kabale district
(2012). A foreign tourist was infected with the
Marburg virus in December 2007 and another one
in July 2008 after visiting python caves in
Imaramagambo forest in current Rubirizi district.
One of the tourist died abroad of Marburg fever
in 2008.
The current Marbug epidemic started as a
cluster of deaths due to a strange illness reported to
the district health office of Kabale on 16th October
2012. The reported deaths occurred in one family in
Rwabirundo village, Kitumba parish, Kitumba sub-

county. The district health office notified the Ministry of
Health of the strange illness/cluster of deaths on
the 18th October 2012. Three blood samples
collected from the initial cases tested positive for
Marburg at Uganda Virus Research Institute,
Entebbe. To that effect, the Ministry of Health
declared an outbreak of Marburg in Kabale district
on the 19th October 2012.
 In response to the outbreak, the Ministry of Health
(MoH) convened an emergency national taskforce
meeting to initiate and coordinate control
interventions to the outbreak. A national rapid
response team comprising of experts from MoH,
UPDF, WHO, CDC, and AFENET was constituted
and deployed to Kabale district on 19th October
2012 to conduct outbreak investigation and support
district response.
Methods
Description of cases
The index case is suspected to be a 33-year old male,
a teacher at Nyakatukura Secondary School in Ibanda
district. He travelled to Ibanda from Kabale, his
home district on 31st August 2012, reportedly healthy.
He fell sick on 3rd September 2012 with complaints
of fever, head ache, loss of appetite and general
body weakness. He sought treatment from Ibanda
Parents Clinic, Ibanda Town Council where he was
treated for Malaria, typhoid fever, and Brucellosis.
His illness continued worsening despite the treatment
prompting him to return to Kabale district on 15th
September 2012. He was admitted in Rugarama
hospital on 17th October 2012 where a provisional
diagnosis of gastroenteritis with malaria was made.
His condition continued deteriorating and he was
referred to Kabale RRH on 19th September 2012
with a diagnosis of acute abdomen. He later on died
on 20th September 2012 and was buried on 22nd
September 2012. Prior to his death, he reportedly
manifested with difficulty in breathing, difficulty in
swallowing and bleeding from the gums. There were
no significant pointers to the likely source of the
infection.
Subsequently, the brother and mother to the
initial case fell sick with similar illness on 25th
September 2012 and 30th September 2012
respectively. The two cases were admitted in
Rugarama hospital from where the mother to the
initial case died on 4th October 2012. The brother
to the initial case referred himself to Kampala for
further medical care where he sought for treatment
from Kampala Medical Chambers. Following his
recovery from the illness, a convalescent sample tested
IgM positive for Marburg. Five other family
members (two sisters, a brother, one maternal uncle,
and a brother in-law) were affected with similar illness
in the subsequent days, three of them eventually died.
The second cluster in this outbreak is linked to a
mortuary attendant who reportedly treated the body
of the initial case. The mortuary attendant, a 32-year
old male working in Kabale RRH developed illness
on 2nd October 2012 and later died on 8th October
2012. Three other confirmed cases (the mother, the
wife and the sister) are linked to the mortuary
attendant; with the mother succumbing to the illness
on 27th October 2012. The third cluster in this
outbreak is linked to a lady Pastor who prayed for
the brother and sister to the initial case. She tested
positive for Marburg on PCR on 30th October 2012.
Another focus of Marburg viral disease was
reported in Ibanda district following confirmation
of three cases from one family in Sigirira village,
Kihani parish, Kikyenkye sub-county in Ibanda district
on 26th October 2012. No obvious epidemiological
link has been established between the Ibanda foci
and the clusters in Kabale.  Investigations however
are ongoing to determine if the outbreaks in Ibanda
and Kabale are epidemiologically linked.
Results
Cumulated cases
As of 13th November 2012, a cumulative of 14
cases (9 confirmed and 5 probable) including 7 deaths
have been registered, giving a case fatality rate (CFR)
of 50%. A total of 202 contacts have been listed;
out of which 193 have completed the 21-day follow-
up period.

Discussion
Uganda has experienced repeated out breaks of
VHFs. The source of infection of the first (index)
human case of Ebola Hemorrhagic fever outbreaks
in all the five outbreaks in Uganda has never been
conclusively determined. In the case of the current
Marburg outbreak in Kabale the source of infection
is yet to be conclusively documented.  In the face of
repeated epidemics hypotheses and research questions
need to be formulated to guide research into the
transmission chain of these epidemics.
The interaction between the viral agent, the
host and the role of the environment need to be re-
examined in setting up the hypotheses.  For example
has the Ebola/Marburg viral genome changed and
able to infect many unknown hosts? Are we able to
detect the infections through heightened surveillance
activities?  This could imply that the VHFs have been
endemic in Uganda. What are the beliefs and
perceptions surrounding these infections? Has human
behaviour changed in the interaction with animals?
Therefore it is imperative to urgently answer these
and other questions in order to design appropriate
actions to prevent and mitigate future VHF
outbreaks.
Currently there is suspicion that there could
be an animal reservoir of the Ebola and Marburg
viruses from where occasional spillage into the human
population occurs resulting in disease outbreaks.
Evidence has been documented that fruit eating bats
(Rousettus aegyptiacus) are carriers of the Marburg virus
and could have been the source of Marburg HF to
humans in 2007 and 2008. It is this linkage that the
VHF ecological studies are expected to uncover by
collecting  and conducting  laboratory analyses of
blood and tissue samples from  animals such as; non-
human primates (e.g. monkeys, chimpanzees,
baboons), bats, small rodents, warthogs and
domestic animals such as pigs, dogs and small
ruminants.
Conclusion
The repeated VHFs in Uganda require urgent
attention.  The MOH together with research
institutions and development partners are discussing
a research agenda that will contribute to mitigation
of future VHF out breaks.
