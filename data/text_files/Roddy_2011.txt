Testing an innovative therapy for ﬁlovirus hemorrhagic fever (FHF) in an outbreak setting may be years away.
Moreover, beyond anecdotal evidence, little is known about best practice for outbreak case management.
Currently, Me
´decins Sans Frontie
`res and others provide FHF patients with basic supportive treatment.
We describe and discuss treatment possibilities, challenges, and potential next steps for FHF outbreak case
management. More comprehensive supportive treatment, including vital sign monitoring, intensive care
components, and goal-directed interventions may contribute to improved clinical outcome; the feasibility and
effectiveness of this more comprehensive supportive treatment should be assessed. Our outlined summary
may assist future FHF outbreak case management teams to create collaborative platforms and develop relevant
treatment protocols aimed at improving clinical outcome.
Filovirus virions are ﬁlamentous, enveloped particles
with a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA genome [1].
Filoviruses are taxonomically separated into 2 genera,
Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus, and comprise the family
Filoviridae. Respectively, they cause Ebola hemorrhagic
fever (EHF) and Marburg hemorrhagic fever (MHF) in
human and nonhuman primates, and are characterized
by person-to-person transmission and high case fatality
[2]. To date, 34 ﬁlovirus hemorrhagic fever (FHF)
outbreaks and laboratory-acquired infections are known
to have occurred in humans (23 EHF and 11 MHF), all
in or originating from sub–Saharan Africa and yielding
approximately 2800 laboratory-conﬁrmed, suspect, or
putative cases [3–7].
Herein, we review treatment possibilities, challenges,
and potential next steps for improving FHF outbreak
case management during outbreaks. Topics include:
(1) innovative treatment, (2) standard supportive
treatment, (3) past and current challenges for outbreak
case management, and (4) recommendations for im-
proved case management. This review may assist future
FHF outbreak case management teams to deliver im-
proved treatment for patients.
INNOVATIVE TREATMENT
Efforts by researchers working in high-containment
laboratories to address the absence of an effective, ap-
proved, and available ﬁlovirus treatment in humans are
ongoing. Evaluated in nonhuman primates (NHPs) and
other animals, some postexposure prophylaxes have
achieved promising results [8–10] and have the poten-
tial to be innovative components of human treatment
[8–12]. Innovative treatment can be divided into 2 cat-
egories: (1) disease-modifying agents, and (2) inhibitors
of viral replication [3].
Disease-Modifying Agents
The pathophysiology of FHF resembles sepsis and
septic shock, with strong inﬂammatory responses and
disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) [13]. This
similarity served as the impetus for animal-model

testing of recombinant human activated protein C (rhAPC;
Xigris, Eli Lilly), a licensed therapy for severe sepsis in humans
[14], which has been used with some success as postexposure
prophylaxis for EHF in NHPs [15]. Coagulation abnormalities
may occur earlier in the disease course than previously thought.
Therefore,
chemotherapeutic
strategies
controlling
over-
expression of tissue factor may also mitigate EHF in NHPs, as
tissue factor can initiate DIC [16]. Recombinant nematode an-
ticoagulant protein c2 (rNAPc2), a clotting inhibitor that blocks
the action of the tissue factor-factor VIIa complex, has also been
demonstrated to attenuate DIC and postinﬂammatory responses
in NHPs [17].
Inhibitors of Viral Replication
Antisense phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs)
[9, 18–20] and short-interfering RNA (siRNA) [10, 21] mole-
cules have been shown to interfere with ﬁlovirus replication.
Building upon past PMO laboratory success [18–20], Warren
et al [9] demonstrated that positively charged PMOs, when
initiated 30–60 minutes after lethal challenge, protect .60% of
rhesus macaques against Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) infection
and 100% of cynomolgus monkeys against Lake Victoria
Marburgvirus (MARV) infection. Likewise, Geisbert et al [10]
showed complete postexposure protection in rhesus macaques
against hemorrhagic fever induced by ZEBOV by administering
anti-ZEBOV siRNAs 30 minutes after lethal challenge and on
6 subsequent days; these ﬁndings compare favorably with earlier
successful postexposure prophylaxes [10, 15, 22, 23]. Positively
charged PMOs and siRNAs, as well as the relative success of
a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus-based vaccine admin-
istered to rhesus macaques 24 and 48 hours postexposure [8],
bring the provision of effective ﬁloviral treatment to human
patients closer. It is hoped that reﬁned targeting of speciﬁc viral
genes and improvements in medication delivery to the host will
improve the effectiveness of antiviral approaches to ﬁlovirus
treatment.
The Availability of Innovative Treatment
Notwithstanding these experimental achievements [8–10], the
availability of an effective and approved treatment for human
testing in an outbreak setting may be years away. Reasons for
this are 2-fold: (1) the development of an innovative treatment
has been slow [8, 12, 24], and (2) researchers have yet to evaluate
treatment success in NHPs later in the disease’s clinical course
[8–10].
Given the current time constraints in the NHP model
(commencement of treatment 30 minutes [10], 30–60 minutes
[9], or 24–48 hours postexposure [8]), the presently envisaged
innovative treatment for humans would primarily beneﬁt those
who know their time of exposure and seek and have access to
immediate care, such as biosafety level 4 laboratory technicians
and health care workers (HCWs). However, short of experi-
encing an accidental needlestick, HCWs may not know when
their exposure occurred and therefore may not seek early
treatment. Furthermore, local populations in outbreak-prone
regions of sub–Saharan Africa who are most ‘at risk’ for ﬁlovirus
infection are typically unaware of the timing of their exposure
and seek medical care only after experiencing severe symptoms.
The 6 laboratory accidents since the 1967 discovery of ﬁlovirus
constitute a diminutive percentage of all recorded infections
(0.21%) [7, 12, 24–26] in comparison with the approximately
2800 known ﬁlovirus infections acquired in sub–Saharan
African outbreak settings [3–7].
Recent achievements in postexposure prophylaxes [8–10]
represent a major breakthrough in ﬁlovirus research. We com-
mend the investigators’ germane questioning [8–10] of how
long treatment can be delayed in NHPs and still have a beneﬁcial
effect. Nonetheless, we remain far from administering an ef-
fective, approved, and available therapy during a human FHF
outbreak in a sub–Saharan African setting. In the meantime,
early case identiﬁcation and contact tracing, with isolation and
provision of supportive treatment in ﬁlovirus wards for in-
dividuals with suspected or laboratory-conﬁrmed infections,
remain the primary strategies for outbreak control and case
management [2, 27–31].
AN OVERVIEW OF STANDARD SUPPORTIVE
TREATMENT
Me
´decins Sans Frontie
`res (MSF), the relevant Ministry of Health
(MoH), and other responding partners and organizations
provide suspect and laboratory-conﬁrmed patients with sup-
portive care when human ﬁlovirus outbreaks occur in their
natural sub–Saharan African setting [28, 29, 32]. Supportive
care, the current standard for FHF treatment, consists of oral
medication, oral ﬂuid rehydration, nutritional supplementation,
and psychosocial support. Oral medication includes drugs that
alleviate FHF-related symptoms such as nausea and vomiting
(eg, metoclopramide and promethazine), dyspepsia (eg, alu-
minium hydroxide, cimetidine, ranitidine, and omeprazole),
anxiety, agitation, or confusion (eg, diazepam, chlorpromazine),
and pain (eg, paracetamol, tramadol, and morphine) when in-
dicated. Due to the usual absence of an onsite laboratory capable
of safely processing biological samples for alternative diagnoses,
empiric oral artemisinin combination therapies for malaria and
empiric oral antibiotics (amoxicillin, cotrimoxazole, ceﬁxime, or
ciproﬂoxacin) are uniformly administered. In the sub–Saharan
African outbreak setting, supportive care has also recently been
expanded to include prevention and treatment of dehydration
via intravenous (IV) ﬂuids, nasogastric delivery of nutritional
and vitamin supplementation, and IV administration of medi-
cation [30]. Administration routes for optimum drug delivery
are determined clinically.

PAST AND CURRENT CHALLENGES FOR
OUTBREAK CASE MANAGEMENT
Adverse Reaction to Disease Control and Case Management
Strategies
Filovirus outbreak response is a formidable undertaking, par-
ticularly as locations are typically remote and fear of the disease
is considerable among patients, communities, and outbreak
response teams. Because of these and other inherent challenges,
numerous errors have been made when implementing control
and case management strategies during outbreaks [30, 33–38].
Community resistance has resulted from dissatisfaction over the
response teams’ poor communication with patients, families,
and community leaders regarding response activities [33, 37,
38], and, at times, refusal by HCWs to offer supportive treat-
ment to infected patients for whom death was assumed to be
certain [30]. Community members have been distressed by
unidentiﬁable HCWs wearing personal protective equipment
(PPE) and anguished by not being allowed to observe the area
surrounding the ﬁlovirus ward, to visit their hospitalized rela-
tives on the FHF ward, or to conﬁrm the deceased’s identity
prior to interment [33, 38, 39].
The resulting fear and anger has led some communities to
refuse collaboration with outbreak response teams, thereby
making case identiﬁcation, contact tracing, and case manage-
ment difﬁcult or impossible. Events in Uganda, Gabon, Republic
of the Congo, and Angola demonstrated that community re-
sistance can become so severe and violent that outbreak re-
sponse teams are prevented from accomplishing their mission
[30, 33–38]. For example, during the 2005 Uige, Angola, MHF
outbreak, verbal and physical aggression toward the team re-
sulted in a temporary suspension of community-based activities
[38], so that only a fraction of the reported cases was isolated
and treated [30, 31]. Patient refusal of isolation and treatment
on a ﬁlovirus ward not only defeated a crucial component of
outbreak control [38], it impeded the establishment and
improvement of outbreak case management [30, 31].
During nearly every ﬁlovirus outbreak, the response team
acknowledged errors and underwent a learning process that
improved the effectiveness of that particular intervention.
However, largely due to ﬁlovirus outbreaks being unpredictable
in both timing and location within sub–Saharan Africa, the
majority of individuals who undergo a learning process are not
present at subsequent outbreaks. As a result, nearly every out-
break response team has experienced a similar cycle of error and
correction when implementing control and case management
strategies. Outbreak response teams have continuously focused
on improving their relations with the affected community while
concurrently implementing measures to reduce secondary dis-
ease transmission; less emphasis has been placed on the pro-
vision of optimum patient care, which may, for some patients,
improve the chance of survival [29–31; personal communication
by ﬁlovirus ward clinicians: Benjamin Jeffs, Esther Sterk, and
Jonas Torp].
Administration and Expansion of Supportive Treatment
Until recently, some ﬁlovirus clinicians were reluctant to
provide components of supportive treatment that potentially
exposed them to patient body ﬂuids, arguing that the risk of
occupational infection outweighed the possible beneﬁt of
increased chances of patient survival. For example, providers
have been reluctant to give IV ﬂuids due to the potential danger
of needlestick injuries. It is now recognized that the majority of
these injuries occur while recapping a used needle rather than
through the process of injection [2, 40], suggesting that paren-
teral drug administration can be performed safely if clinicians
and nurses adhere strictly to biosafety measures, which include
staff training and supervision, safe venipuncture material, proper
lighting, and adequate disposal of sharps [30, 41]. The provision
of intravenous volume replenishment is a cornerstone of ef-
fective sepsis treatment; insofar as pathophysiological processes
in FHF mirror those of other sepsis syndromes, parenteral
ﬂuids may improve clinical outcome for some patients.
Filovirus clinicians’ recent willingness to expand supportive
care reﬂects their increasing conﬁdence in establishing contact
with patient body ﬂuids while wearing full PPE [30] (Figure 1).
This behavioral change was also a response to anecdotal
evidence suggesting that an expanded supportive treatment
strategy favorably inﬂuences FHF patients’ clinical outcome [30,
42]. Clinicians were also aware of the 3.8 times higher case
fatality proportion observed during the 1998–2000 Durba
and Watsa MHF (83%) outbreaks compared with the 1967
MHF outbreaks in Germany and former Yugoslavia (22%).
A disparity in the provision of supportive treatment was

blood sample for laboratory confirmation from a patient potentially
infected with Ebola virus during the Bundibugyo, Uganda, 2007–08 Ebola
hemorrhagic fever outbreak. When wearing full personal protective
equipment, filovirus ward clinicians are increasingly confident to
establish contact with patient body fluids and deliver a more expanded
supportive treatment. Photo by Claude Mahoudeau.

theorized to have been a contributing factor to the considerable
difference in survival ratios [31].
Though laudable, the recent expansion of supportive care is
limited. To date, standard patient monitoring of vital signs
(respiratory rate, blood pressure, and pulse), pulmonary signs
(rales), and ﬂuid intake-output ratios are not systematically
monitored and thus are not components of expanded sup-
portive treatment. Furthermore, expanded supportive treatment
lacks essential components of intensive care such as the cor-
rection of electrolyte and metabolic derangement, goal-directed
management of hemodynamics, oxygen supplementation, and
immune modulating and other mitigation strategies for hyper-
inﬂammatory responses and DIC [43]. A more comprehensive
supportive treatment strategy, including vital sign monitoring
and intensive care components, may contribute to improved
clinical outcome; its feasibility and effectiveness should be
assessed.
Generating Evidence for Improved Case Management
The collection and analysis of quality patient clinical data had
low priority in the majority of past ﬁlovirus outbreaks. Little
information has therefore been gathered about best practice for
ﬁlovirus case management beyond anecdotal evidence [30, 31].
Systematic collection of relevant data has also been hindered, in
part, by safety concerns regarding transferring patient clinical
records from inside the ﬁlovirus ward to outside. Records were
often nonexistent, haphazardly logged, or destroyed as being
potentially infected fomites. The standardization of data col-
lection templates [44] and the prioritization of transferring
clinical data from inside the ﬁlovirus ward to the outside [45]
have, to some extent, helped to overcome these obstacles in
recent outbreaks.
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVED CASE
MANAGEMENT
With clinical data collection now prioritized and the need for
more comprehensive care obvious, the feasibility and effective-
ness of a comprehensive supportive treatment strategy should be
deﬁned, applied, and assessed. However, a study to assess
treatment effectiveness has not been, to date, attempted in a ﬁ-
lovirus outbreak setting.
Detecting an association between comprehensive supportive
treatment and clinical outcome would require the application of
an appropriate study design to the collection and analysis of
quality data. An appropriate study design may include a ran-
domized, controlled trial (with respect for clinical equipoise) or
an observational study; quality data must subsume patient
demographics, clinical manifestations over the course of the
illness, treatment regimen(s) administered, and clinical out-
come. In concordance with an already suggested framework [3],
institutions responsible for supporting ﬁlovirus outbreak case
management, such as MSF and the World Health Organization
(WHO), must create a collaborative platform aimed at de-
veloping a comprehensive supportive treatment protocol ap-
proved by institutional and outbreak-prone-country MoH
ethical review boards. The collaborative platform should be
functional prior to the occurrence of FHF outbreaks and be
sufﬁciently agile and resilient to be deployed upon outbreak
recognition. The protocol should incorporate ‘‘best available’’
standards of care, and, if and when available for an outbreak
setting, include innovative treatment under appropriate ethical
and clinical supervision. Speciﬁcally, investigators (WHO, MSF,
and others) must (1) develop a deﬁnition of a comprehensive
supportive treatment that can be administered under ﬁeld
conditions, (2) establish an appropriate evaluation scheme, (3)
develop the protocol, and (4) implement the study protocol at
a future ﬁlovirus outbreak in collaboration with the relevant
MoH. Of note, MSF can ensure logistics, such as cold chain
and relevant medical supplies, for the administration of an
innovative treatment under ﬁeld conditions.
A comprehensive and supportive treatment assessment
initiative, coupled with the recording and analysis of quality
epidemiological and clinical data, would contribute to the evi-
dence base for ﬁlovirus case management. Pending the de-
velopment of an innovative therapy, this may be the only way for
future sub–Saharan African ﬁlovirus outbreak patients to receive
care that may favorably inﬂuence their chance of survival.

Patients from phase III RCTs
Patients from unique real-world cohorts 
DOVATO is indicated for the treatment of Human Immunodeﬁciency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) 
infection in adults and adolescents above 12 years of age weighing at least 40 kg, with no 
known or suspected resistance to the integrase inhibitor class, or lamivudine.13
Adverse events should be reported. Reporting forms and information can be found at 
https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/ or search for MHRA Yellowcard in the Google Play 
or Apple App store. Adverse events should also be reported to GSK on 0800 221441

FOOTNOTES
*Data extracted from a systematic literature review of DTG+3TC real-world evidence. Overlap 
between cohorts cannot be fully excluded.
**The reported rate reﬂects the sum-total of resistance cases calculated from GEMINI I and 
II (n=1/716, through 144 weeks), STAT (n=0/131, through 52 weeks), and D2ARLING (n=0/106, 
through 24 weeks).5–7
†GEMINI I and II are two identical 148-week, phase III, randomised, double-blind, multicentre, 
parallel-group, non-inferiority, controlled clinical trials testing the eﬃcacy of DTG/3TC in 
treatment-naïve patients. Participants with screening HIV-1 RNA ≤500,000 copies/mL were 
randomised 1:1 to once-daily DTG/3TC (n=716, pooled) or DTG + TDF/FTC (n=717, pooled). The 
primary endpoint of each GEMINI study was the proportion of participants with plasma HIV-1 
RNA <50 copies/mL at Week 48 (ITT-E population, snapshot algorithm).13
‡STAT is a phase IIIb, open-label, 48-week, single-arm pilot study evaluating the feasibility, 
eﬃcacy, and safety of DTG/3TC in 131 newly diagnosed HIV-1 infected adults as a ﬁrst line 
regimen. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 
copies/mL at Week 24.6
§D2ARLING is a randomised, open-label, phase IV study designed to assess the eﬃcacy 
and safety of DTG/3TC in treatment-naïve people with HIV with no available baseline HIV-1 
resistance testing. Participants were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive DTG/3TC (n=106) or 
DTG + TDF/XTC (n=108). The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with plasma 
HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL at Week 48.7 Results at week 24 of the study.
||The reported rate reﬂects the sum-total of resistance cases calculated from TANGO (n=0/369, 
through 196 weeks) and SALSA (n=0/246, through 48 weeks).8,9
¶TANGO is a randomised, open-label, trial testing the eﬃcacy of DOVATO in virologically 
suppressed patients. Participants were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive DOVATO (n=369) 
or continue with TAF-containing regimens (n=372) for up to 200 weeks. At Week 148, 298 of 
those on TAF-based regimens switched to DOVATO. The primary eﬃcacy endpoint was the 
proportion of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥50 copies/mL (virologic non-response) as per 
the FDA Snapshot category at Week 48 (adjusted for randomisation stratiﬁcation factor).8,13
#SALSA is a phase III, randomised, open-label, non-inferiority clinical trial evaluating the eﬃcacy 
and safety of switching to DTG/3TC compared with continuing current antiretroviral regimens 
in virologically suppressed adults with HIV. Eligible participants were randomised 1:1 to switch 
to once-daily DTG/3TC (n=246) or continue current antiretroviral regimens (n=247). The primary 
endpoint was the proportion of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥50 copies/mL at Week 48 (ITT-E 
population, snapshot algorithm).9
