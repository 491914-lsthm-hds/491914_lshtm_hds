Viruses in the Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus genera (family Filoviridae) have been associated with large outbreaks of hemor-
rhagic fever in human and nonhuman primates. The ﬁrst documented cases occurred in primates over 45 years ago, but the
amount of virus genetic diversity detected within bat populations, which have recently been identiﬁed as potential reservoir
hosts, suggests that the ﬁloviruses are much older. Here, detailed Bayesian coalescent phylogenetic analyses are performed on 97
whole-genome sequences, 55 of which are newly reported, to comprehensively examine molecular evolutionary rates and esti-
mate dates of common ancestry for viruses within the family Filoviridae. Molecular evolutionary rates for viruses belonging to
different species range from 0.46  104 nucleotide substitutions/site/year for Sudan ebolavirus to 8.21  104 nucleotide sub-
stitutions/site/year for Reston ebolavirus. Most recent common ancestry can be traced back only within the last 50 years for Res-
ton ebolavirus and Zaire ebolavirus species and suggests that viruses within these species may have undergone recent genetic
bottlenecks. Viruses within Marburg marburgvirus and Sudan ebolavirus species can be traced back further and share most re-
cent common ancestors approximately 700 and 850 years before the present, respectively. Examination of the whole family sug-
gests that members of the Filoviridae, including the recently described Lloviu virus, shared a most recent common ancestor ap-
proximately 10,000 years ago. These data will be valuable for understanding the evolution of ﬁloviruses in the context of natural
history as new reservoir hosts are identiﬁed and, further, for determining mechanisms of emergence, pathogenicity, and the on-
going threat to public health.
V
iruses of the Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus genera (family Filo-
viridae) are nonsegmented, negative-strand RNA viruses that
are, with few exceptions, responsible for severe hemorrhagic fever
outbreaks in Africa with high case fatality (1). Filovirus transmis-
sion among humans occurs through direct human-to-human
contact or contact with their infectious bodily ﬂuids, particularly
in the late stages of infection, when viral loads are highest. Histor-
ically, the largest outbreaks have been health care facility based,
with virus spread increased by poor barrier nursing techniques
and reuse of needles or other medical devices in the absence of
disinfection. Virus dissemination within communities is further
exacerbated by common African burial practices that include
communal washing of bodies, particularly by women, who are
also the primary caregivers within families.
Within the genus Ebolavirus, ﬁve viruses are recognized (Ebola
virus, Sudan virus, Reston virus, Taï Forest virus, and Bundibugyo
virus), each representing a distinct virus species (Zaire ebolavirus,
Sudan ebolavirus, Reston ebolavirus, Taï Forest ebolavirus, and
Bundibugyo ebolavirus). In contrast to the genus Ebolavirus, the
genus Marburgvirus contains a single virus species (Marburg mar-
burgvirus), albeit consisting of two distinct viruses, Marburg virus
and Ravn virus (2), which are approximately 20% divergent from
one another (3). The ﬁloviruses are primarily African in origin,
with the exception of Reston virus, which so far has been found
only in the Philippines or in nonhuman primates originating in
the Philippines. In addition, an Ebola-like ﬁlovirus, Lloviu virus,
was recently identiﬁed in bats in Spain (4) and likely represents
another distinct genus.
While Ebola virus infections can result in a case fatality ap-
proaching 90% (1), the case fatalities associated with other viruses
of the genus Ebolavirus appear to be considerably lower. The case
fatality associated with Sudan virus infections ranges from 53 to
66% (5, 6), and that of Bundibugyo virus is estimated near 40%
based on epidemiologic ﬁndings from the 2007 Uganda outbreak
(7–9). Reston virus, while highly pathogenic for nonhuman pri-
mates, does not appear to cause disease in humans (10, 11). In the
Philippines, several abattoir workers on infected pig farms were
found to be seropositive for Reston virus yet reported no clinical
symptoms (12). Finally, Taï Forest virus has been described only
in a single nonfatal human case (13). Marburg and Ravn virus
infections can result in case fatalities ranging from approximately
20% to 90% (3, 14, 15).
Genetic investigations of ﬁlovirus outbreaks have found them
to be of two general types, those that are the result of a single
introduction into the human population followed by person-to-
person spread and those outbreaks that result from multiple in-
troductions followed by short chains of human transmission.
During person-to-person transmission, there appears to be little

molecular evolution of the virus (3, 16). Initial introduction into
the human population is often thought to result from contact with
infected carcasses of nonhuman primates or other mammals or
direct contact with an infected reservoir host (17–21). Despite
numerous attempts to identify the natural reservoir(s) of the ﬁlo-
viruses over the past 30 years, only recently have bats been im-
plicated as possible reservoirs for the ebolaviruses and marburg-
viruses (20–24). Over the past 10 years, ﬁlovirus RNA and
antibodies have been detected in several bat species, but it was not
until 2007 that Marburg and Ravn virus isolates were recovered
from Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) associated with a
small outbreak of Marburg hemorrhagic fever in southwestern
Uganda (21). In contrast to the low virus genetic diversity ob-
served with person-to-person virus transmission during human
outbreaks, potential bat reservoir populations appear to harbor
genetically diverse virus populations at single geographical loca-
tions (20, 21).
Although the ﬁloviruses are thought to have originated quite
some time ago, age estimates have ranged from a few thousand
(25, 26) to hundreds of thousands (4) to a few million (27, 28)
years ago. Further confusing the issue, some authors have pre-
sented data indicating that viruses of at least one ﬁlovirus species
(Zaire ebolavirus) share a most recent common ancestor (MRCA)
in the very recent past (29–32). Previous studies have attempted to
estimate rates of nonsynonymous substitutions and divergence
times among viruses within the Filoviridae; however, most have
been limited in terms of sample size (25) or have examined only a
single species, in particular, Zaire ebolavirus (29, 31, 32). Here, we
perform detailed Bayesian coalescent phylogenetic analyses on 97
virus whole-genome sequences (55 of which are newly reported
here) to comprehensively examine the evolutionary rates of the
ﬁloviruses and estimate dates of common ancestry within this
family. Such information is valuable for understanding the evolu-
tion of viruses in this family in the context of natural history,
pathogenicity, and ongoing threat.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Viral RNA extraction, reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), and whole-
genome sequencing by primer walking were performed as previously de-
scribed (3, 33) or as follows, with primers speciﬁc for each virus species.
The Ebola virus genome was ampliﬁed in seven overlapping RT-PCR
fragments (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). The Sudan virus
genome was ampliﬁed in ﬁve overlapping fragments, with a few excep-
tions (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). In some cases, fragment
A was ampliﬁed in 2 smaller fragments (A1 and A2). In other cases, nested
reactions were performed (fragments C and D) using the original frag-
ment primers found in Table S1 in the supplemental material for the ﬁrst
round and a second set of primers (also shown in Table S1 in the supple-
mental material) for the nested reaction.
Individual data sets were constructed for each virus species and for the
family as a whole (see Table S2 in the supplemental material). Bundibugyo
and Taï Forest viruses and the recently described Lloviu virus were ex-
cluded from intraspeciﬁc analyses since only a single genomic sequence
has been generated for each virus. These viruses were, however, included
in analyses examining the family Filoviridae as a whole. Multiple sequence
alignments were generated by Clustal X (34) or the MAFFT function (35)
in SeaView (36) with subsequent prooﬁng by eye.
Bayesian coalescent phylogenetic analysis, implemented in the BEAST
software package, was used to determine the molecular evolutionary rate
and an estimate of the time to the most recent common ancestor for each
of the data sets (37). The HKYG nucleotide substitution model was
chosen for its simplicity, to avoid overparameterizing the analyses, and for
direct comparison among data sets. Preliminary analyses consisting of
10,000,000 generations were performed to identify the most appropriate
clock (strict versus relaxed uncorrelated lognormal versus relaxed uncor-
related exponential) and demographic (constant versus Bayesian skyline
population size) models (38) for each species-speciﬁc data set. A Yule
process, rather than a coalescent prior, was chosen to more accurately
account for the speciation process when analyzing the family Filoviridae as
a whole. Model selection was based on an analysis of marginal likeli-
hoods (39), calculated in Tracer version 1.5. Once the nucleotide sub-
stitution, molecular clock, and demographic models were chosen (Ta-
ble 1), ﬁnal analyses were run for a total of 10,000,000 to 390,000,000
generations to ensure effective sample sizes (ESSs) of at least 200.
Maximum clade credibility trees were constructed using the software
programs TreeAnnotator and FigTree (37). Additionally, the Path-O-
Gen
program
(available
from
http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software
/pathogen/) was used to run root-to-tip regressions in order to inde-
pendently test the assumption of a molecular clock (i.e., temporal
signal) for each of the individual species data sets.
Nucleotide sequence accession numbers. Sequences generated in this
study were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers KC242783 to
KC242801, JX477165, JX477166, and JX458825 to JX458858.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION.
Zaire ebolavirus. The Zaire ebolavirus data set consisted of 22
Ebola virus whole-genome sequences. These included samples
from outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) (for-
merly Zaire) that were collected in the mid- to late 1970s near
Yambuku (3 samples), in the mid-1990s around Kikwit (3 sam-
ples), and most recently between 2007 and 2008 near Luebo,
Democratic Republic of Congo (9 samples). Seven additional se-
quences were generated from cases collected in Gabon during the
mid-1990s and in 2002. The outbreaks in Yambuku and Kikwit
were the largest known Ebola virus outbreaks on record (300
cases each). Both outbreaks were hospital based and likely the
result of single virus introductions into the human population
followed by rapid spread between patients, health care workers,
and their families. Sequencing of portions of the highly variable
glycoprotein (GP) gene from fatal and nonfatal patients at the
beginning and end of the Kikwit outbreak found no sequence
variation whatsoever (16). In contrast, the recurrent but smaller
outbreaks in Gabon were characterized by shorter transmission
chains of multiple virus lineages and were epidemiologically and
genetically linked to repeated contact with infected nonhuman
primates or other mammals scavenged (or hunted) in the nearby
forests (18).

is low, with a maximum 2.7% nucleotide difference between se-
quences. Within a single outbreak, genetic diversity was even
lower. For example, sequences from patients in Luebo, Demo-
cratic Republic of Congo, collected in 2007 and 2008 were less
than 0.07% divergent. While a degree of spatial clustering was
apparent due to the inherent nature of human outbreaks, viruses
clustered temporally (Fig. 1). Interestingly, viruses from the Dem-
ocratic Republic of Congo fell into three separate clades: those
from the 1970s occupied the basal position of the tree, whereas
viruses in the remaining two clades were sister to viruses collected
from Gabon during similar time spans (i.e., 1994 to 1996 and 2002
to 2008). A similar pattern was observed among viruses collected
in the Democratic Republic of Congo between 1976 and 2008
when examining the glycoprotein (GP) and nucleoprotein (NP)
genes (30); however, those results suggested that viruses from Lu-
ebo shared greater similarity with a virus collected in 1976 in Yam-
buku than with a 1995 virus from Kikwit (30). Our results, based
on whole-genome sequences, suggested that these viruses were
equidistant (approximately 2% divergent).
Bayesian coalescent analyses estimated that the most recent
common ancestor (MRCA) of these extant viruses occurred
around 48 years prior to 2008, or around 1960 (Table 2 and Fig. 1),
16 years before Ebola virus was ﬁrst recognized (40, 41). In addi-
tion, our analyses suggested that viruses similar to those found
during the Luebo outbreak may have been circulating since 2005,
2 years before the outbreak was ﬁrst recognized. The molecular
evolutionary rate was relatively rapid and was estimated at 7.06 
104 nucleotide substitutions/site/year (Table 2). An independent
root-to-tip regression analysis using the Path-O-Gen program re-
sulted in an estimate contained within the 95% highest posterior

density (HPD) interval from the Bayesian coalescent analysis
(2.2  104 nucleotide substitutions/site/year; correlation coefﬁ-
cient  0.89). While it is possible that Ebola virus emerged only
recently, the low level of genetic diversity despite a moderately fast
molecular evolutionary rate, coupled with the previously hypoth-
esized ancestral age of the ﬁloviruses overall, suggests that Ebola
virus has more likely undergone a recent genetic bottleneck, a
hypothesis that others have proposed as well (29, 30, 32). Given
the dependence of a zoonotic virus on its host population, it is easy
to envision a scenario in which the number of susceptible hosts
declines, for a variety of possible reasons, and results in a small
effective viral population size and a subsequent loss of genetic
diversity that would limit our ability to trace the virus back
through time. Alternatively, the virus may have jumped into a new
host or into a new geographic area in the recent past, resulting in a
founder effect (29).
Sudan ebolavirus. Sudan virus ﬁrst emerged in 1976 in Nzara,
southern Sudan, where it appeared again in 1979. Both outbreaks
were hospital based, with the 1976 outbreak causing 284 cases,
53% of which were fatal. Sudan virus did not reappear until 2000,
when it was found to be the agent responsible for the largest ebo-
lavirus outbreak on record, 425 cases, in Gulu, Uganda. Genetic
studies of the Gulu outbreak found no evidence of virus evolution
during human-to-human transmission or between viruses from
fatal or nonfatal cases (6). Since 2000, Sudan virus has emerged
two more times, causing a limited outbreak in 2004 in Yambio,
Sudan (only 25 km from Nzara), and a single case in 2011 in
Luwero district outside Kampala, Uganda. The full-length ge-
nome sequences of these viruses are examined here. Compared to
viruses within the species Zaire ebolavirus, those within the species
Sudan ebolavirus appear to be much more geographically con-
strained, with all ﬁve outbreaks occurring within a 400-mile range,
presumably a reﬂection of the limited distribution of the natural
reservoir or other ecological constraints.
The Sudan ebolavirus data set consisted of 5 Sudan virus whole-
genome sequences, one from each outbreak. Interestingly, viruses
clustered spatially rather than temporally, with the Ugandan iso-
lates forming a well-supported clade distinct from those collected
in Sudan (Fig. 2). Genetic diversity of the isolates collected within
each country was low (less than 0.4% for Sudan and approxi-
mately 0.6% for Uganda) and, in the case of viruses collected in
Sudan, highlights the ability of this species to maintain genetic
stability over a nearly 30-year span. The overall diversity of viruses
within the species was also low, with a maximum of 5.2% nucle-
otide divergence between samples collected in Sudan in 2004 and
Uganda in 2011.
The molecular evolutionary rate was estimated at 0.46  104
nucleotide substitutions/site/year, and viruses within this species
appear to have shared a MRCA more than 800 years before the
present (Table 2 and Fig. 2). A similar rate, 0.39  104 nucleotide
substitutions/site/year, was obtained from the root-to-tip regres-
sion (correlation coefﬁcient  0.89). This evolutionary rate esti-
mate is much slower than that calculated for the more pathogenic
Ebola virus and suggests that Sudan virus may be signiﬁcantly
older. Alternatively, given the hypothesis that Ebola virus has un-
dergone a recent genetic bottleneck, it may just be that we are able
to trace the MRCA further back for Sudan virus. Analyses sug-
gested that the virus isolates from Sudan shared a MRCA approx-
imately 79 years before 2011 while the Ugandan viruses shared a
MRCA around 99 years ago (Fig. 2).
Given the close geographic proximity of northern Uganda and
southern Sudan, it is interesting to see such a genetic division
between samples from the two neighboring countries. According
to these analyses, the virus has been circulating for hundreds of

years, with the extant lineages arising around 100 years before the
present. This would appear to be ample time for the viruses to
cocirculate and may suggest that some unknown ecological con-
straint has kept these two lineages from becoming panmictic or
genetically homogeneous over time. It is possible that the two
lineages are being maintained in different hosts—either in dis-
tinct species or subspecies or in populations that have been geo-
graphically isolated. The Albertine Rift, which runs along the bor-
der of the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda, Rwanda,
etc., and the mountains that ﬂank this region (the Virungas in
eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, the Ruwenzoris in west-
ern Uganda, etc.) have acted as biogeographic barriers for a num-
ber of small mammals and birds historically (42–47), so it is not
unreasonable to think that this region may serve as a biogeo-
graphic barrier for Sudan virus and/or its reservoir host as well.
Additional samples of Sudan virus will be needed to explore this
issue further given the small sample size currently available.
Reston ebolavirus. To date, the origins of all known Reston
virus outbreaks have been epidemiologically linked to the Philip-
pines. First appearing in 1989 in infected monkeys consigned
from a breeding/export facility in the Philippines to laboratories
in Reston, VA, the virus was highly lethal in the imported animals
but caused asymptomatic infections in four animal care workers
that worked with the monkeys (48, 49). The same Philippine ex-
port facility was the source of two more outbreaks following the
export of infected monkeys to Sienna, Italy, in 1992 and Alice, TX,
in 1996. More recently, in 2008 and 2009, Reston virus appeared
repeatedly in Philippine swine in association with high-density pig
farming operations. Interestingly, follow-up studies found that
pigs experimentally infected with Reston virus (50) can shed virus
from the mucosa in the nasopharynx in the absence of clinical
disease, consistent with the possibility that the virus could circu-
late undetected in pigs. The Reston ebolavirus data set analyzed
here included 7 Reston virus whole-genome sequences, each from
outbreaks with epidemiologic linkage to the Philippines. Four of
these viruses were collected from pigs during the 2008/2009 out-
break in the Philippines, with the other 3 sequences representing
isolates associated with animals that were imported from the Phil-
ippines and subsequently involved in nonhuman primate out-
breaks in Pennsylvania in 1989/1990 and Texas in 1996.
In the recent Reston virus outbreaks in the Philippines, there
appears to be no temporal or spatial clustering patterns. The virus
genetic diversity found on the same farm (farm A) from 2008 to
2009 (a 1-year period) was 0.079%, while simultaneous sampling
in 2008 of a single farm (farm CE) found the divergence to be
approximately 4.5%. Further interpretations of these data are dif-
ﬁcult in the absence of detailed records of porcine movement be-
tween farms before and during these outbreak periods. Similar to
Ebola virus, it appears as though Reston virus is evolving at a rate
(8.21  104 nucleotide substitutions/site/year) signiﬁcantly
faster than that of Sudan virus (Table 2). The root-to-tip regres-
sion suggested a highly similar rate estimate of 8.5  104 nucle-
otide substitutions/site/year (correlation coefﬁcient  0.99).
Likewise, extant Reston viruses share an ancestor in the recent
past, approximately 30 years before 2009 (Table 2 and Fig. 3), or in
1979, 10 years prior to the initial identiﬁcation of Reston virus in a
shipment of cynomolgus monkeys from the Philippines to the
United States (11). Again, based on the assumption that the ﬁlo-

viruses are ancient viruses, it appears likely that Reston virus (like
Ebola virus) has also undergone a recent genetic bottleneck. Dur-
ing the late 1970s, there was an increase in human population in
the Philippines along with an increase in logging and deforesta-
tion (see the report at www.fao.org/docrep/003/X6967E/x6967e0
7.htm). It is possible that the reservoir of Reston virus was nega-
tively affected by these changes, potentially resulting in a genetic
bottleneck. Alternatively, perhaps the virus jumped into pigs
around that time, and based on the demonstrated ability of exper-
imentally infected pigs to shed virus in the absence of disease, the
virus has circulated among pigs since that time, with nonhuman
primates serving as accidental or spillover hosts. Another alterna-
tive is that the bottleneck indicates a founder effect from a recent
introduction into the Philippines, possibly from mainland Asia,
given that the Philippines is an island nation, or even from ship-
ments of monkeys sent from Africa as part of the exotic pet trade.
Marburg marburgvirus. The Marburg marburgvirus data set
included 60 sequences consisting of virus genomes from 48 hu-
man samples and 12 bat isolates. Of these full-length sequences, 34
(27 human and 7 bat) are newly reported here. Marburg virus was
ﬁrst identiﬁed in 1967 in monkeys consigned from Uganda to
Europe (19), while Ravn virus was identiﬁed from a fatal human
case in Kenya 20 years later. More recently, the cave-dwelling
Egyptian fruit bat, Rousettus aegyptiacus, has been identiﬁed as a
potential natural reservoir for Marburg and Ravn viruses (Mar-
burg marburgvirus), consistent with historical linkage of Marburg
hemorrhagic fever (MHF) outbreaks directly to subterranean en-
vironments, particularly African gold mines or caves, where these
bats can live in high-density colonies ranging in size up to several
hundred thousand. Outbreaks among gold miners in Durba,
DRC, from 1998 to 2000 and Ibanda, Uganda, in 2007 consisted of
at least 11 combined spillover events from the natural reservoir,
followed by short chains of human-to-human transmission.
The largest Marburg virus outbreak on record, consisting of
252 cases and 227 deaths, occurred in Angola in 2005. The origin
of the Angola outbreak was never determined, but epidemiologic
investigations found health clinics to be implicated as primary
conduits for virus dissemination. Genetic studies, like those for
the Ebola virus outbreak in Kikwit and the Sudan virus outbreak
in Gulu, found very little virus evolution during the outbreak,
with some whole-genome sequences (19,114 nucleotides [nt]) in
the Angola outbreak showing 100% identity despite coming from
patients infected 6 weeks apart.
As others have demonstrated previously, genetic diversity be-
tween Ravn virus and Marburg virus was high, at approximately
20% (3, 20, 21). Despite signiﬁcant divergence at the nucleotide
level, Marburg and Ravn viruses still exhibit a high proportion of
amino acid conservation, with the exception of the glycoprotein
gene (3), a ﬁnding which adds to the body of evidence supporting
these viruses as members of a single species. Ecological investiga-
tions (20, 21) have found the entire known genetic spectrum of

this species to simultaneously circulate among R. aegyptiacus bats
at any one location, including both Ravn and Marburg viruses.
Aside from the human outbreak in Angola in 2005, temporal
and spatial structure was nonexistent. As mentioned above, mul-
tiple distinct lineages of the Marburg marburgvirus species, includ-
ing both Marburg and Ravn viruses, were identiﬁed in single caves
associated with large bat populations in both Uganda and the
Democratic Republic of Congo (Fig. 4, note Bat sequences). Oth-
ers have shown the same relationship based on partial genetic
sequences (20, 21), indicating the potential for a long-term asso-
ciation between Marburg and Ravn viruses and their hypothesized
reservoir hosts. The lack of spatial and temporal structure also
suggests that the viruses may have a long evolutionary history
within the region and have had sufﬁcient time to geographically
mix (panmixia). Indeed, this ﬁts with the hypothesis of bats as the
reservoir host. High contact rates due to sheer density among
these cave-dwelling bats could easily account for the levels of
transmission necessary to maintain the virus in the environment
over time. Furthermore, given the vagility or potential movement
of bats in general, it is not surprising to expect signiﬁcant gene
ﬂow among viruses associated with the bats, even over a poten-
tially large region. What remains a mystery, however, is the main-
tenance of two distinct viruses in the absence of spatial structure.
The molecular evolutionary rate for Marburg and Ravn viruses
was estimated at 5.67  104 nucleotide substitutions/site/year
(Table 2), which is moderate in relation to Ebola and Reston vi-
ruses but still much quicker than the molecular evolutionary rate
of Sudan virus. The estimate obtained from the root-to-tip regres-
sion (2.0  104 nucleotide substitutions/site/year; correlation
coefﬁcient  0.76) was contained within the 95% HPD interval
generated in the Bayesian coalescent analysis. The estimated time
to the MRCA for the Marburg and Ravn viruses overall was ap-
proximately 700 years before 2009, with the Ravn viruses sharing a
MRCA much more recently, approximately 48 years ago (Fig. 4).
Marburg viruses may be older, as they share a MRCA over 200
years ago (Fig. 4).
For all virus species, not just Marburg marburgvirus, it is pos-
sible that phylogenetic dating methodologies might underesti-
mate the age of older viral divergence events due to saturation of
synonymous substitutions (26), resulting in a loss of the true ex-
tent of evolutionary change over time. This is especially true for
more-variable genes, like the glycoprotein gene, that undergo
strong purifying selection (26, 51).
Filoviridae. Finally, in order to examine overall evolutionary
history of the family Filoviridae, we constructed a data set consist-
ing of representatives from each species within the Ebolavirus and
Marburgvirus genera as well as the recently described Lloviu virus.
This method assumes that each sequence represents a distinct spe-
cies; therefore, one representative per species was selected for in-
clusion in the analysis, with a couple of exceptions. In the case of
the Marburg marburgvirus species, we included several Marburg
and Ravn virus representatives to account for the vast amount of
genetic diversity present within the species. In addition, we in-
cluded 2 representatives of Ebola virus to test whether the overall
family tree would capture a time to MRCA similar to the estimate
generated by the single-species data set. The molecular evolution-

ary rate was estimated at 8.95  104 (95% HPD interval, 0.94 
104 to 2.33  104) nucleotide substitutions/site/year, slightly
faster than but similar to the rates estimated for Ebola virus and
Reston virus. According to our analyses, which were designed to
take into account the patterns associated with speciation pro-
cesses, particularly emergence and extinction events, the family
Filoviridae shares a MRCA approximately 10,400 (95% HPD in-
terval, 6,535 to 16,244) years ago (Fig. 5), which is about the time
the Earth emerged from the last ice age. Our estimate is similar to
a previous calculation (7,100 to 7,900 years) based on synony-
mous and nonsynonymous substitution ratios (25) and far
younger than other recent assessments using non-clock-based
methods that rely on the assumption of ﬁlovirus-like elements
that appear to have been integrated into the genome of a variety of
mammals and subjected to different evolutionary pressures (27,
28). Additional approximations of MRCA that resulted in older
estimates than those generated in this study differed in terms of
more-limited numbers of whole-genome taxa as well as method-
ology (4, 26). One such study (4) employed a coalescent prior,
which is most suitable for analyzing relationships among mem-
bers of the same population or species, to generate a hypothesized
date of MRCA for the family. Our study utilized a Yule prior,
which is most suitable for examining relationships among mem-
bers of different species.
Another study (26) suggested that high levels of sequence di-
vergence and potential saturation issues may bias Bayesian esti-
mates toward younger age estimations, and this may be the case
with our data set as well; however, that particular study examined
only viruses of the genus Ebolavirus. At the very least, our analysis
provides another hypothesis and a minimum estimate of most
recent common ancestry for extant viruses within the family Filo-
viridae. Our results correspond well with at least one previous
estimate (25) for the group, and our family-wide analysis was able
to recover an estimate of MRCA for Ebola virus very similar to that
of the analysis examining Ebola virus alone, indicating a good
degree of robustness in the data. Regardless, ﬁloviruses are clearly
much older than what their initial detection in the 1960s might
suggest. The species appear to be evolving continuously, with vi-
ruses of some species (Zaire ebolavirus and Reston ebolavirus, for
example) likely undergoing recent genetic bottlenecks. The pro-
cesses contributing to the genetic bottlenecks of these viruses, yet
not those of others, remain unknown and highlight the impor-
tance of examining the biology of the ﬁloviruses as well as their
distinct reservoir hosts. As we learn more about the reservoirs of
the other ﬁloviruses, we will be able to use characteristics of the
hosts to make predictions regarding the viruses. For example,
the range of the virus will depend on the range of the host to
some extent, along with other external abiotic factors that in-
ﬂuence the host directly (and, thus, the pathogen indirectly).
Furthermore, virus evolution clearly depends on the host—for
the number of susceptible hosts available for the virus to infect,
the number of potential opportunities that a virus has for
transmission due to the social or sexual interactions of the host
species, and more. Much work remains to decipher exactly how
these viruses have evolved over time and in relation to their
host species.
