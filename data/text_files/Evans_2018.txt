Background.  Human and filovirus host interactions remain poorly understood in areas where Ebola hemorrhagic fever out-
breaks are likely to occur. In the Bwindi region of Uganda, a hot spot of mammalian biodiversity in Africa, human livelihoods are 
intimately connected with wildlife, creating potential for exposure to filoviruses.
Methods.  We tested samples from 331 febrile patients presenting to healthcare facilities near Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, 
Uganda, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis and Western blot, using recombinant glycoprotein antigens for Ebola virus 
(EBOV), Sudan virus (SUDV), Bundibugyo virus (BDBV), and Marburg virus. Behavioral data on contact with wildlife were col-
lected to examine risk factors for filovirus seropositivity.
Results.  All patients were negative for active filovirus infection, by PCR analysis. However, patients were seroreactive to SUDV (4.7%), 
EBOV (5.3%), and BDBV (8.9%), indicating previous exposure. Touching duikers was the most significant risk factor associated with 
EBOV seropositivity, while hunting primates and touching and/or eating cane rats were significant risk factors for SUDV seropositivity.
Conclusions.  People in southwestern Uganda have suspected previous exposure to filoviruses, particularly those with a history 
of wildlife contact. Circulation of filoviruses in wild animals and subsequent spillover into humans could be more common than 
previously reported.

Since the discovery of filoviruses 5 decades ago, Ebola hem-
orrhagic fever (EHF) and Marburg hemorrhagic fever (MHF) 
outbreaks have become more frequently recognized and pose 
great risk for regional and international spread [1]. Increased 
contact between humans and wildlife in regions where wildlife 
hosts live or migrate is likely contributing to this rise in filovirus 
outbreaks [2]. Elucidation of human and animal host interac-
tions are needed to institute behavioral changes and risk miti-
gation aimed at prevention in regions where hemorrhagic fever 
outbreaks are prone to occur.
Based on field and experimental studies, Pteropodidae 
fruit bats have been indicated as reservoirs for Marburg virus 
(MARV) and suggested as possible hosts for Ebola virus (EBOV) 
[3–5]. Direct exposure to fruit bats through consumption and 
close proximity (eg, by sharing dwellings and entering mines or 
caves) has been linked to human EHF and MHF outbreaks in 
Uganda and other parts of East/Central Africa [6–9]. In addi-
tion, MARV and EBOV sequences have been detected in insec-
tivorous bats (Rhinolophus eloquens, Miniopterus inflatus, and 
Hipposideros species), but no links to human EHF and MHF 
have been reported [4, 10]. It is unknown whether filoviruses 
are circulating regularly in bat populations.
Contact with nonhuman primates has also been implicated 
as a source of human infections with EBOV and Taï Forest virus 
(TAFV) [11, 12]. However, nonhuman primate species infected 
with EBOV and TAFV have had severe or fatal illness, suggest-
ing that they are not suitable reservoir species but could poten-
tially transmit filoviruses to humans when hunted and handled 
after death [12–14]. Members of the Ebolavirus genus have been 
implicated as one of the causes of the decline of wild common 
chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and western lowland gorillas 
(Gorilla gorilla gorilla) [14, 15] and are considered a major 
threat to the survival of African great apes [16].
Limited evidence exists for other wild and domestic animal 
species potentially playing a role in filovirus transmission to 
either humans and/or other great apes. Duikers (Cephalophus 
species), small forest antelopes, have been implicated as inci-
dental hosts for EBOV [13]. An increase in brush-tailed porcu-
pine (Atherurus africanus) and wild bush pig (Potamochoerus 
larvatus) mortality has also temporally and geographically 
coincided with human EHF outbreaks [17]. In addition, EBOV 
RNA has been detected in 2 Muridae rodent genera and 1 
shrew species (Sylvisorex ollula), although attempts to isolate 
the virus were unsuccessful [18]. Swine have been confirmed 
as susceptible domestic animal hosts for Reston virus [19] and

immunoglobulin G (IgG) EBOV antibodies have been detected 
in sera from domestic dogs in close proximity to an EBOV epi-
demic area [20].
Despite multiple pieces of evidence, further investigation 
and confirmation of potential wildlife reservoirs and additional 
incidental hosts for filoviruses is lacking, partly due to mini-
mal systematic wildlife surveillance efforts and the availability 
of accurate diagnostic tests. Challenges which have hampered 
filovirus surveillance in wildlife include a very short time frame 
within which to detect viral shedding in animals involved in ini-
tial spillover of filoviruses to humans and difficulties in achiev-
ing necessary sample sizes in suspected animal reservoirs, 
particularly among species with unknown population size. 
Limitations in availability of accurate diagnostic testing include 
requirement of maximum containment (biosafety level 4) facil-
ities to conduct virus isolation and cross-reactivity between 
filovirus species among available serological assays. In addition, 
surveillance and diagnostic capabilities are likely complicated 
by the presence of unknown filoviruses, which have the poten-
tial to cross-react with serological diagnostics and influence 
immunological susceptibility of reservoir and incidental hosts.
In consideration of these challenges facing wildlife studies, 
human serological assays optimized for detection of filoviruses, 
combined with epidemiologic data on human-wildlife contact, 
could provide valuable insight into the geographic distribution 
of filoviruses, as well as the wildlife populations in which to 
focus further studies. Previous human serological studies have 
linked activities such as scavenging gorilla, chimpanzee, and 
duiker carcasses to EHF outbreaks in Gabon [12, 13, 21] and 
have identified forest-dwelling human populations and peo-
ple living in close proximity to forests in the Central African 
Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) as 
high-risk human groups for EBOV exposure [22, 23].
In this study, we investigated potential exposures to filovi-
ruses among acutely febrile patients from the Bakiga and Batwa 
tribes in southwestern Uganda, and identified possible risk fac-
tors for filovirus seropositive status using detailed livelihood 
and behavior surveys. The Bakiga are agriculturalists, whereas 
the Batwa were previously hunter-gatherers prior to their 
displacement from the interior of the Bwindi Impenetrable 
Forest. The Batwa now live in settlements surrounding Bwindi 
Impenetrable National Park and have become one of the most 
marginalized human groups in Uganda. The park dominates 
this region and is a biodiversity hotspot, harboring among the 
largest number of primate species of any forest in Africa, 
including the critically endangered mountain gorilla (Gorilla 
beringei beringei) [24]. Our study objectives were to (1) identify 
whether humans in the Bwindi region have had past exposures 
to filoviruses, by testing for the presence of IgG antibodies to 
specific filovirus glycoproteins (GPs), and (2) identify wild-
life species and types of wildlife interactions associated with 
human exposure to filoviruses.
METHODS
Human Subjects
A total of 331 patients from Bwindi Community Hospital and 
Byumba Health Center II presenting with fever and accompany-
ing clinical signs were voluntarily enrolled in the study between 
March and June 2013 (Figure 1). Inclusion criteria included non-
specific signs of viral illness, such as fever (ie, body temperature 
>37.8°C), vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nasal congestion, 
and/or cough. Blood samples and oropharyngeal swab specimens 
were collected from each participant. Questionnaires to collect 
demographic information, travel history, medical history, infor-
mation on livelihood(s), and interactions with domestic and wild 
animals were administered in the local language, Runyankore-
Rukiga. The aim of the study was communicated to all patients 
or parents/guardians of minors, and written informed consent 
was obtained from all study participants. Institutional review 
boards at Makerere University, Bwindi Community Hospital, the 
University of California–Davis, and the Uganda National Council 
for Science and Technology approved this study.
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)–Based Diagnostic Techniques
Total nucleic acid was extracted from whole-blood and 
oral swab specimens, using the NucliSens MiniMag system 
(bioMérieux) according to manufacturer’s instructions, with 
the exception of the addition of a 2-hour proteinase K digestion 
step with mechanical disruption for whole-blood samples. RNA 
was reverse transcribed and complementary DNA (cDNA) 
synthesized using Superscript III First-Strand Synthesis cDNA 
kits (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). cDNA was analyzed by con-
ventional PCR analysis for the filovirus L gene, using primers 
previously designed by Zhai et  al [25]. A touchdown proto-
col was programmed, using a Fast Cycling PCR kit (Qiagen, 
Germantown, MD), with the following reaction conditions: 1 
cycle at 95°C for 5 minutes; 12 cycles at 96°C for 8 seconds, 65°C 
(with a 1°C decrease during each subsequent cycle) for 8 sec-
onds, and 68°C for 18 seconds; 35 cycles at 96°C for 8 seconds, 
52°C for 8 seconds, and 68°C for 18 seconds; and 1 cycle at 72°C 
for 5 minutes. PCR products of appropriate size were cloned 
using Topo TA cloning kits (Invitrogen), and sequencing was 
performed using Sanger dideoxy sequencing at the University 
of California–Davis DNA sequencing laboratory.
Western Blots
Samples were γ-irradiated with a dose of 2 MRad before screen-
ing [26]. Samples were denatured in 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol, 
and proteins were separated on 10% mini-protean TGX gels 
(Biorad, Hercules, CA) and transferred to Amersham Hybond 
0.45 polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (GE-biosciences, 
Marlborough, MA). Blots were blocked in 5% nonfat milk and 
1% normal goat serum. Membranes were incubated with serum 
at a 1:100 dilution overnight at room temperature. Membranes 
were then incubated with peroxidase-labeled antibody to human 
Filovirus Exposure Among People Contacting Wildlife  •  JID  2018:218  (Suppl 5)  •  S279
IgG (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) at a 1:5000 dilution. The follow-
ing antigens were used: EBOV, SUDV, and MARV strain Musoke 
recombinant virus GPs (IBT Bioservices, Gaithersburg, MD) and 
Bundibugyo virus (BDBV) strain Uganda 2007 recombinant, 
partial virus envelope GP1 (Ile 33–Gln 304; Acro Biosystems, 
Newark, DE). Antigens were produced in mammalian cells.
Western blots were validated using convalescent serum from 
a human who was vaccinated with a recombinant vesicular sto-
matitis virus (VSV)–based vaccine that expressed an EBOV 
GP (VSV-EBOV) after suspected EBOV exposure [27], con-
valescent serum from a MARV-infected nonhuman primate, 
rabbit anti-SUDV GP polyclonal antibody (IBT Bioservices), 
and convalescent serum from a rhesus macaque experimen-
tally infected with BDBV [28]. A negative control pool of serum 
specimens from 20 Ugandan individuals who presented to the 
Bwindi Community Hospital with respiratory symptoms and 
showed no filovirus seroreactivity on Western blots, as well as 
a negative control pool of serum specimens from 5 individuals 
from other African countries, were used as negative controls. 
In addition, 15 serum samples collected from volunteer blood 
donors at the Stanford Blood Center (Palo Alto, CA) were used 
as negative controls during assay development.
Blots were considered positive for virus if a band of the cor-
rect size could be visualized for the GP1 protein of EBOV, SUDV, 
and MARV (approximately 150 kDa; Supplementary Figure 1 
and 2) and the partial GP1 protein of BDBV (approximately 60 
kDa; Supplementary Figure 3) after visual comparison to pos-
itive and negative control samples. A conservative approach to 
interpretation of Western blot band results was taken in that 
samples were tested in duplicate and were categorized by 2 
independent researchers as positive, negative, or indeterminate, 
based on visualization of appropriate sized bands.
Statistical Analyses
Individuals with positive and negative samples were used in risk 
factor analyses and period prevalence calculations; individuals 
with indeterminate results due to faint bands were excluded (sam-
ple sizes used in statistical analyses were as follows: 300 for SUDV 
analyses, 301 for EBOV analyses, 303 for BDBV analyses, and 331 
for MARV analyses). Period prevalence and 95% binomial exact

confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for demographic 
groups for each filovirus species. When period prevalence was 0, 
1-sided, 97.5% binomial exact CIs were calculated.
All demographic factors, including age, tribe, and livelihood 
(Table 1), were evaluated for associations with animal contact 
behaviors (Tables  2 and 3), using bivariate analyses to assess 
confounding. Associations between filovirus seropositive status 
and all individual risk factors in Tables 1–3 were initially evalu-
ated by the 2-sided Fisher exact test or the χ2 test as appropriate, 
and associations were measured by odds ratios (ORs). Multiple 
exposures were common, and some behavior categories were 
associated with each other; therefore, adjustment for various 
risk factors in multivariable analyses was done sequentially, with 
priority given to those with a higher OR on crude analysis, those 
that were highly significant, and those factors with previous evi-
dence based on other investigations.
Multivariable logistic regression was then used to assess the 
association of risk factors with filovirus exposure for variables 
that were significant on bivariate analysis (P < .1). Separate logistic 
models were generated for each filovirus species to account for 
variation in wildlife reservoirs and the risk of transmission to sus-
ceptible people. Multivariable logistic regression was also used to 
assess the association between demographic and livelihood fac-
tors and wild animal contact. Variables were included if they 
significantly improved model fit, based on the likelihood ratio 
test (P < .1), while minimizing the Akaike information criterion. 
Overall model fit was assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow 
goodness-of-fit test [29]. All statistical analyses were performed 
using Stata (StataCorp, College Station, TX). Network analyses 
to generate a wildlife taxa-interface network display (Figure 2) 
were conducted in the network analysis platform Gephi, using 
the force-directed algorithm ForceAtlas2 [30].

RESULTS
Detection of Previous Exposure to SUDV, EBOV, and BDBV
Febrile patients in this study did not exhibit any signs of hem-
orrhagic fever and no patients reported having suffered a hem-
orrhagic illness previously. Diagnoses provided by medical 
facilities included, malaria, pneumonia, typhoid fever, respi-
ratory infection, urinary tract infection, gastritis, brucellosis, 
and tuberculosis. All patients had negative results on consensus 
PCR tests of blood and oral swab specimens for detection of 
filoviruses. Among study participants, 14 of 300 were seropos-
itive for SUDV, 16 of 301 were seropositive for EBOV, and 27 
of 303 were seropositive for BDBV by conventional Western 
blot (Table 1). Seropositivity to MARV was not detected. One 
sample was positive for both EBOV and SUDV, and 1 was pos-
itive for both EBOV and BDBV. Serologic results for SUDV, 
EBOV, and BDBV were not significantly correlated with each

homes was widespread (99% [270 of 274 patients]), and con-
tact with animals that were raiding crops (93% [255 of 274]) 
and sharing food items (91% [296 of 325]) was also common. 
Contact with animals through bushmeat hunting was less 
commonly reported (5% [13 of 274 patients]; Figure 2).
On multivariable analysis, men were more likely than 
women to consume wildlife (OR,  3.18; 95% CI, 1.09–9.32; 
P = .035) and to touch duikers (OR, 6.62; 95% CI, 1.55–28.21; 
P = .011). People working as park personnel were 9.5 times 
as likely to consume wildlife than people with other occu-
pations (95% CI, 1.43–63.25; P = .020). People of the Batwa 
tribe were also 9.7 times as likely to consume wildlife (95% 
CI, 2.08–44.84; P = .004), 7.1 times as likely to hunt wild ani-
mals (95% CI, 1.20–41.55; P = .031), and 9.5 times as likely to 
touch a duiker (95% CI, 1.71–52.76; P = .010) than people of 
the Bakiga tribe.
Wildlife Contact Associated With EBOV Seropositivity
Results of our multivariable model showed that people with a 
history of touching duikers were 5.6 times as likely to be sero-
positive for EBOV than people who reported no contact with 
duikers (95% CI, 1.23–25.17; P = .026; Table 2 and Table 4). Age 
group was included in the model because a history of touching 
duikers was found to increase with age. The log odds of EBOV 
seropositivity was predicted by use of the following logistic 
model: ln[P(x)/1 − P(x)] = −2.64 − 0.11(A) + 1.72(Td), where 
P(x) denotes the probability of a person being seropositive for 
EBOV (Hosmer-Lemeshow model goodness-of-fit χ2 = 76.38; 
P = .785), A denotes age in years, and Td denotes a history of 
touching a duiker.
Wildlife Contact Associated With SUDV Seropositivity
Results of our multivariable model showed that people report-
ing a history of hunting primates were 37.5 times as likely to 
have evidence of past exposure to SUDV than people who did 
not report hunting primates (95% CI, 6.20–226.41; P < .001; 
Table 4). Also, people with a past history of touching or eat-
ing cane rats (Thryonomys swinderianus) were 10.7 times as 
likely to show serologic evidence for past exposure to SUDV 
than people who did not report touching or eating cane rats 
(95% CI, 1.95–58.15; P = .006; Table 4). Tribal affiliation was 
included in the model because being of Batwa ethnicity was 
significantly associated with hunting wild animals. On bivar-
iate analyses, both touching and eating cane rats were inde-
pendently associated with SUDV seropositivity (Table 3) but, 
when combined, were a better predictor of risk of exposure, 
and they were therefore incorporated as a combined variable 
into the multivariable model. The log odds of SUDV seropos-
itivity was predicted by use of the following logistic model: 
ln[P(x)/1 − P(x)] = −3.81 + 1.79(T) + 2.37(Cte) + 3.62(Ph), where 
P(x) denotes the probability of a person being seropositive for 
SUDV (Hosmer-Lemeshow model goodness of fit χ2  =  0.42; 
P = .810), T denotes tribe, Cte denotes a history of touching or 
eating a cane rat, and Ph denotes a history of hunting primates.

Figure. 2.  Epidemiologic bipartite network map showing disease transmission interfaces shared by humans and wildlife in the Bwindi region of southwestern Uganda. 
For transmission interfaces (blue), the node size is proportionate to the number of people reporting direct or indirect contact with wildlife at each interface. For wildlife taxa 
(purple), the node size is proportionate to the number of people reporting contact with each respective wildlife taxa. Highly connected and more-central interfaces represent 
greater opportunities for contact with multiple wildlife host taxa and therefore present greater chances for humans to encounter zoonotic pathogens. This network was 
created using data on contact between humans and animals that were collected from 331 febrile individuals presenting to medical facilities in the Bwindi region. aPorcupines 
are reported separately from rodents because porcupines were not considered to be in the same animal category as smaller rodent species by local study participants.

No variables describing contact between humans and wildlife 
were significant on bivariate analysis for BDBV.
DISCUSSION
We provide evidence for previous exposure to filoviruses 
among people in the Bwindi region of southwestern Uganda. 
Our serologic findings fill a gap in geographic exposure data 
for the region, as outbreaks of EHF have occurred in neighbor-
ing districts of Bundibugyo and Kibaale and across the border 
in the DRC [9, 31–33], and MHF has occurred in Kabale and 
Maramagambo forests [9, 34, 35].
It is unlikely that clinically significant EHF cases have occurred 
and gone unreported in the Bwindi region, given the accessibil-
ity of Bwindi Community Hospital and its associated satellite 
clinics. Additionally, cases of filovirus-associated hemorrhagic 
fever in mountain gorillas, a species heavily monitored, highly 
contacted by people, and susceptible to filovirus infection, have 
not been reported. Identification of IgG antibodies to filovirus 
GPs in humans presenting to clinics in Bwindi therefore could 
be due to asymptomatic infection with SUDV, EBOV, or BDBV 
and/or infection with serologically cross-reactive low-pathoge-
nicity or nonpathogenic undiscovered filoviruses that also have 
wildlife hosts.
Previous studies suggest that EBOV infections can by asymp-
tomatic or minimally symptomatic [36–38]. Seropositivity 
in people who did not report a history of hemorrhagic fever 
has been demonstrated in EHF-endemic regions [23, 39], and 
asymptomatic family members of patients infected with known 
filovirus species have shown seropositivity [40]. We also cannot 
rule out the possibility that we detected antigenically similar but 
as-yet unknown filoviruses. Additional filoviruses are expected 
to be discovered as diagnostic assays and surveillance activities 
improve. Past serosurveys using antigens that are more broadly 
reactive among filoviruses have detected filovirus exposure 
among humans and wildlife living in areas where no cases of 
EHF have ever been reported, such as the Aka population of 
the Central African Republic [22] and fruit bat populations in 
Bangladesh [41]. We used GP antigens in this study because 
it is predicted that the antibody response to GP is more virus 
specific, owing to the larger genetic variability with this protein 
[42]. Serologic cross-reactivity between filovirus species has 
however been noted in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays 
using recombinant GP antigens, although the highest reactions 
were uniformly detected against the GP antigen homologous to 
the correct virus species [43].
Interestingly, no one tested positive for a previous expo-
sure to MARV, even though outbreaks of MARV infection 
have occurred in close proximity to the Bwindi region. An 
outbreak of MARV infection occurred in 2012 in Kabale 
District [44], approximately 26 km from the southern corner 
of Bwindi Impenetrable Forest. In addition, 2 foreigners who 
visited caves in Maramagambo Forest in the southern corner of 
Queen Elizabeth National Park, approximately 80 km from the 
northern-most corner of Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, exported 
MARV in 2008 to the United States and the Netherlands 
 
[45, 46]. MARV has a documented case-fatality rate between 
24%–88%, indicating that there is potential for detection of 
seropositive survivors [47, 48]. Our lack of detection of MARV-
seropositive people in the Bwindi region suggests that exposure 
to MARV could be rarer than for other filoviruses and that 
wildlife reservoirs are more restricted in range or habitat.
We found variations in seroprevalence among people 
engaged in different activities involving wildlife, providing epi-
demiologic evidence that filoviruses circulating in Bwindi are 
of wildlife origin. In contrast to similar studies in West and 
Central Africa, where bushmeat hunting is the major activity 
leading to human and wild animal contact, we found a broader 
scope of activities that leads to interaction with wildlife.
Contact with duiker was identified as a risk factor for EBOV 
exposure. Duikers are frequently eaten by humans in many 
parts of equatorial Africa and have been previously implicated 
as incidental hosts for EBOV. Duikers are believed to become 
infected with EBOV through scavenging nonhuman primate 
carcasses [13], an activity that is plausible in Bwindi given the 
prevalence and diversity of nonhuman primate species. Duikers 
are the most common animal caught in snares in Bwindi 
Impenetrable National Park, and people directly contact this 
species through hunting, food preparation, and consumption. 
Duikers also frequently leave the forest and can be found crop 
raiding among private gardens.

Filovirus Exposure Among People Contacting Wildlife  •  JID  2018:218  (Suppl 5)  •  S285
Hunting primates was identified as a significant risk factor for 
SUDV seropositivity, consistent with previous findings, which 
have linked outbreaks of EHF, caused by EBOV
, to contact with 
dead common chimpanzees and/or western lowland gorillas [12, 
13]. Interestingly, contrary to previous beliefs that hunting and 
consumption of primates was almost nonexistent in Uganda [24], 
we identified several people presenting to Bwindi Community 
Hospital who reported hunting primates or knowing others in 
their close community who hunted primates. All hunting of ver-
tebrate species living within Uganda’s forest reserves is prohibited 
by law, and Ugandans generally consider primate meat consump-
tion culturally unacceptable. Hunting of primates, however, may 
be on the increase in this region because of population growth 
both within Uganda and through influx of refugees from the 
DRC, where primate bushmeat consumption is more common.
Contact with cane rats was also identified as a risk factor for 
SUDV exposure. Rodents have been identified as potential filovi-
rus hosts in previous investigations, but evidence has been weak 
and they have received less attention as more evidence has pointed 
toward bats and primates as reservoirs and incidental hosts, respec-
tively. Cane rats are of particular concern as a potential host for 
infectious diseases because of their proximity to people. They com-
monly range freely around human dwellings and are also raised as 
a source of meat in West and Central Africa. In the Bwindi region, 
cane rats are one of the most commonly eaten wildlife species and 
are frequently found raiding crops and food storage areas, where 
people indirectly contact their feces and/or urine.
Finding evidence for filoviruses in Bwindi could have impli-
cations not only for the human communities surrounding and 
using the park but also for the critically endangered mountain 
gorilla. Human and mountain gorilla health and livelihoods 
in this region are intimately connected; they are susceptible 
to the same pathogens, and gorilla tourism supports the local 
economy, which in turn preserves the forest. A filovirus hemor-
rhagic fever outbreak in Bwindi could have devastating impli-
cations for humans and gorillas alike. Additionally, if unknown 
filoviruses are circulating in Bwindi, which theoretically could 
confer some degree of cross-protective immunity, this might 
help explain why filovirus-associated hemorrhagic fever out-
breaks have not been reported to date in this region. A better 
understanding of the filoviruses circulating in Bwindi, as well 
as their hosts and/or likely reservoir species, is needed to rec-
ognize and better understand any potential threat. We conclude 
that broader surveillance strategies are needed, moving beyond 
dead nonhuman primates and the bat species tested to date, to 
characterize filovirus transmission cycles in Africa.
