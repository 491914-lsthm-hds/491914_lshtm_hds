Abstract. In the present serologocal study 120 monkey sera from different species 
originating from the Philippines, China, Uganda and undetermined sources and 
several groups of human sera comprising a total of 1288 specimens from people 
living in Germany were examined for the presence of antibodies directed against 
filoviruses (Marburg virus, strain Musoke/Ebola virus, subtype Zaire, strain 
Mayinga/Reston virus). Sera were screened using a filovirus-specific enzyme- 
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). ELISA-positive sera were then confirmed 
by the indirect immunofluorescence technique, Western blot technique, and a 
blocking assay, and declared positive when at least one cornfirmation test was 
reactive. Altogether 43.3 % of the monkey s 
era and 6.9 % of the human sera reacted 
positively with at least one of the three different filovirus antigens. The blocking 
assays show that antibodies, detected in the sera, are directed to specific filovirus 
antigens and not caused by antigenic cross-reactivity with hitherto unknown 
agents. Data presented in this report suggest that subclinical filovirus infections 
may also occur in humans and in subhuman primates. They further suggest that 
filoviruses are not restricted to the African continent. 
Introduction 
The prototypes of the family Filoviridae [22] are Marburg virus (MBG) and Ebola 
virus (EBO) which both cause severe hemorrhagic disease. Filovirus infections 
were unknown until 1967, when 25 persons in Germany (cities of Marburg and 
Frankfurt) and Yugoslavia (city of Belgrad) became infected with MBG after 
contact with tissues and blood from African green monkeys (Cercopithecus 
aethiops) imported from Uganda. Seven of these cases resulted in death. In 
addition, six secondary non-lethal cases of infection occurred [26, 30]. All African

green monkey infected experimentally with the virus died [29, 35]. Suprisingly, no 
specific antibodies were found in sera from monkeys captured in the same area 
where the shipment to Germany and Yugoslavia had originated. Since then, 
sporadic, virologically confirmed Marburg disease cases have occurred in various 
parts of Africa: South Africa, 1975 [12], Kenya, 1980 [39], and Kenya, 1987 [24]. 
The geographically and temporally distinct MBG outbreaks appear to have been 
due to genetically distinguishable, but antigenetically closely related virus strains 
[24]. 
EBO first emerged in two major outbreaks which occurred almost simul- 
taneously in Zaire and Sudan in 1976 [41, 42]. There were more than 550 cases 
and more than 430 resulted in death [2, 18]. Two subtypes were isolated which 
differ in pathogenicity, antigenicity, and genomic composition [3, 9]. They were 
morphologically identical with, but serologically distinct from MBG. The case 
fatality rate of the Zaire and Sudan subtypes was 88% and 53%, respectively. 
However, secondary and tertiary cases had lower fatality rates, suggesting 
attenuation of the virulence with human-to-human pasasages. In 1977, another 
fatal case was reported from Zaire [13], and in 1979, EBO hemorrhagic disease 
occurred again in Sudan with 34 cases of which 22 resulted in death [1, 43]. 
Serological studies suggest that infections with EBO or related viruses have 
occurred in several African countries [15]. No antibodies have ever been found in 
specimens of feral animals, including more than 200 monkeys collected in Zaire 
and Sudan. 
In 1989, a third filovirus, serologically related to EBO, was isolated when an 
explosive epizootic occurred in monkeys (Maccaca 
fascicularis) imported to the 
United States from the Philippines [16]; most of the monkeys died. The agent, 
called Reston virus (RES), is infectious to humans but does not seem to cause 
serious human disease [5, 15]. 
Filoviruses are enveloped, nonsegmented negative-stranded RNA viruses. The 
genome has a molecular weight of approximately 4.2 X 106 [31]. Virions contain at 
least seven structural proteins, nonstructural proteins have not yet been detected. 
The structural proteins are: an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L protein), a 
glycoprotein (GP), a major (NP) and a minor (VP30) nucleoprotein, two proteins 
(VP40, VP24) associated with the viral membrane, and VP35 which is thought to be 
the P (NS)protein equivalent of paramyxo- and rhabdoviruses [10, 11, 24, 27, 33, 
34]. 
The natural reservoirs for human infection with MBG and EBO and the 
natural reservoir of RES are unknown. Serological studies employing enzyme- 
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or immunofluorescence assay have suggest- 
ed that EBO antibodies are present in a number of human and animal populations 
in parts of Africa [17, 37, 40]. Recent serological investigations using indirect 
immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and Western blot were performed in connection 
with the RES epizootic in the Unites States on sera of persons with varying levels of 
exposure to monkeys. Of these sera 7.6% reacted positively with one or more of the 
different filovirus antigens. In addition, randomely selected sera of persons 
without known exposure were tested by the same assays resulting in 2.7 % positives 
[6-8]. 
In this study we analyzed sera of monkeys from different species and countries 
as well as human sera from different parts of Germany. All sera were examined 
using IFA, ELISA, and Western blot techniques. Sera positive to one of the 
filovirus antigens were further analyzed in a blocking assay.

Materials and methods 
Viruses and cell line 
The Musoke strain of MBG isolated 1980 in Kenya [39], the Mayinga strain of EBO, a Zaire 
subtype isolated in 1976 [42], and the RES [6, 16] were used. The viruses were grown in E6 cells, a 
cloned cell line of Vero cells (American Type Culture Collection CRL 1586). 
Growth and purification of viruses 
E6 cells were infected with the different viruses at a multiplicity of infection of 10 
-2 plaque- 
forming units/cell. Following an adsorption period of 30min at 37~ 
infected cells were 
incubated in Dulbecco medium containing 2% fetal calf serum. Virus was harvested 8 days post 
infection (cytopathic effect approximately 85 %) for MBG and EBO. RES was harvested 14 days 
post infection, and the medium was changed at day 7 post infection. Virus purification was 
performed as described previously [10, 23, 27, 32]. 
Serum samples 
Monkey sera were obtained from healthy animals imported to Germany and Switzerland from 
the Philippines (Macacafascicularis, imported in November 1989 and January 1990; 31 sera), 
China (Macaca 
mulatta, imported in September 1990; 37 sera), Uganda (Cercopithecus 
aethiops; 
colonies founded in 1978; 43 sera) and species from undetermined origin and date of import 
(Macaca 
nemestrina, 
2 sera; Macaca 
mulatta, 7 sera). Human sera were obtained from following 
sources: 673 sera sent for routine diagnostics to the department of Virology at the University of 
Marburg, 475 sera of persons undergoing routine health control, 89 sera from blood donors, 56 
sera from persons (taken in 1972) with contact to patients suffering of Marburg hemorrhagic 
disease, and 32 sera from persons, living in the surrounding of Greifswald (former GDR). 
Western blot analysis 
Viral proteins were separated on 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide slabgels (SDS- 
PAGE) as described by Laemmli [25]. Preparative gels were loaded with 20 lag viral proteins and 
were run at 30 mA for 1.5 h. After electrophoresis proteins were blotted onto PVDF-membranes 
(Millipore, #P-15552) by semi-dry blot technique. The PVDF-blots were cut into stripes which 
then were incubated with human and monkey sera at a dilution of 1 
: 100 in phosphate-buffered 
saline (PBS)/0.2% Tween20. Horseradish peroxidase(HRP)-coupled rabbit anti-human IgG 
was used at a dilution of 1:300 in PBS/0.2% Tween 20 for detecting bound antibodies. 
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
96-well polystyrene plates (Flacon, #3072) were coated overnight with suspensions of SDS- 
inactivated virus at a concentration of 1 lag/ml. The coating buffer contained 2.93g sodium 
hydrogen carbonate and 1.59g dihydrogen sodium carbonate/IH20 , pH9.8. Subsequently, 
plates were washed three times with PBS/0.2% Tween20 and nonspecifie binding sites were 
blocked by incubation in PBS containing 3 % bovine serum albumin for 16 h at 4~ 
Plates were 
washed again (see above) and incubated with human and monkey sera ta a dilution of 1 
: 100 in 
PBS/0.2% Tween20 for 1 h. After further washing bound antibody was detected with HRP- 
labelled anti-human-IgG antibodies at a dilution of 1:500 in PBS/0.2% Tween20. The 
absorbance was measured at 492 nm with 650 nm reference wavelength. 
46 
Blocking assay 
Human and monkey sera positive to antigens from one of the three different filoviruses (MBG, 
EBO, RES) were incubated in 96-well polystyrone plates coated with either the homologous (e.g., 
MBG-positive sera with MBG antigen) or heterologous antigen preparation (MBG-positive sera 
with RES antigen, EBO-positive sera with MBG antigen and RES-positive sera with EBO 
antigen) for 16 h at 4~ 
Subsequently, the preincubated sera were removed and examined on 
ELISA plates coated with the homologous antigen (e.g., MBG-positive sera with MBG antigen) 
or in Western blot analysis as described above. 
Indirect immunofluorescence 
Monolayers of virus-infected cells (3 days post infection) were dispersed with trypsin, washed 
with PBS, and applicated to uncoated areas of epoxy-coated slides (Bio Merieux). Infected 
cells were incubated for further 24h at 37~ 
washed with PBS, fixed with cold (--20~ 
acetone for 20min, and air-dried (can be stored at --20~ for several months). For antibody 
screeening slides were incubated with human and monkey sera at dilutions of 1:40 and 1:10, 
respectively, in a buffer containing 145 mM NaC1, 0.1 mM CaC12, 0.5 mM MgC12, 7 mM sodium 
barbital; 10 mM sodium azide, pH 7.2. Detection was performed using FITC-conjugated anti- 
human IgG antibodies (DAKO). 
Results 
Monkey sera 
A total of 120 monkey sera from different species originating from different 
countries were tested for the presence of antibodies directed against filoviruses by 
ELISA, IFA, and Western blot techniques. None of the monkeys was known to 
have suffered from MBG or EBO hemorrhagic fever or similar diseases. The results 
are summarized in Table 1. All the sera were first screened in an ELISA, the 
positive ones were further examined either by IFA or Western blot technique. Sera 
were declared as positive when the results of at least two assays corresponded. 
Altogether 43.3% of the sera reacted positively with one of the used filoviruses 
(MBG, EBO, RES).

Western blot results were declared positive when two or more of the known 
virion proteins were detected. Most of the positive sera reacted with several viral 
proteins (NP, VP40, VP35, VP30), only a few reacted with VP24. Hoever, none of 
the investigated sera reacted with the GP and the L protein of any of the three 
filoviruses (Fig. 1). Some sera reacted positively with more than one filovirus. 
In IFA analyses, positive sera showed the typical staining seen during filovirus 
infections in infected cells (Fig. 2c). Intracytoplasmic viral inclusion bodies 
consisting of viral nucleocapsid were predominantly visuable [28, 29]. None of the

sera showed a positive immunofluorescence with the surface antigen (GP) of 
filovirus-infected cells. These observations are in good agreement with the Western 
blot results. Additional immunofluorescence tests using anti-GP monoclonal 
antibodies, however, resulted positive showing that the GP is present in the 
membrane of infected cells (data not shown). 
The highest prevalence of antibodies against filoviruses (76%) were found in 
the group of Cercopithecus aethiops originating from Uganda at least 12 years ago, 
which have been kept together in colonies over the years. The Macaeaefasciculares 
which were imported from the Philippines in November 1989 and January 1990 
also reacted positive to a high degree (39%). These animals were kept separate 
during quarantine. The lowest number of antibody positive sera were detected in 
the group of Macacae mulattae imported from China in September 1990 (16%). 
The two Macacae nemestrinae from an unknown source were negative, but the 
number of monkeys examined is too low to make any statement about this species 
(Table 1). 
Human sera 
A total of 1288 human sera of different origins were analyzed for antibodies 
directed against different filovirus antigens (MBG, EBO, RES). Sera were screened 
using an ELISA. ELISA-positive sera were further examined by more reliable 
techniques (IFA and Western blot) to verify the results. None of the tested people 
had a record of former MBG or EBO hemorrhagic fever or any comparable 
disease. A group of 56 sera were taken in 1972 from persons, who had been at risk 
by contact to patients suffering from MBG hemorrhagic disease. The various 
groups of human sera from different origin showed no statisticly significant 
differences concerning antibody prevalence against filoviruses, this applies also to 
the 56 sera of the risk group. They were, therefore, further treated as one group.

Table 2 shows the results of the seroepidemiological study with 1288 sera. 
Altogether 89 sera (6.9 %) were ELISA positive to filoviruses with 2.6 % for MBG, 
0.85% for EBO, and 3.4% for RES. Out of the 89 filovirus-positive sera 34 (38.2%) 
reacted with MBG, 11 (12.4%) with EBO, and 44 sera (49.4%) with RES. 
In western blot analyses sera were considered positive when they would stain 
with at least two of the viral proteins. In accordance with the monkey sera none of 
the positive sera reacted with the GP and L protein of the filovirus antigens used in 
this assay (Fig. 3). Most of the sera reacted with the NP, less with one or more of 
VP40, VP35, and VP30, only a few reacted with VP24. Antibodies directed against 
the L protein could not be found even in sera of persons with known history of 
MBG or EBO hemorrhagic disease (Fig. 4). Western blot analyses confirmed an 
average of 74% of the ELISA-positive sera, in detail 80% MBG, 77% EBO, and 
66% RES (Table 2). 
IFA-positive sera showed an intracytoplasmic immunofluorescence and no 
staining of the cell nucleus. Viral antigen in coarse and fine aggregates could be 
seen (Fig. 2). These aggregates consists of the viral nucleocapsid (inclusion bodies). 
Sera showing a positive immunofluorescence with the surface protein (GP) of 
filovirus-infected cells were not found. This is in agreement with the Western blot 
results and the IFA and Western blot results of the tested monkey sera. IFA 
analyses confirmed the results of about 80 % of the ELISA-positive sera, in detail 
85% MBG, 75% EBO, and 80% RES (Table 2). 
Blocking assays were performed to corroborate the specificity of the positive 
sera. When sera positive for antibody to one of the filovirus antigens were 
preincubated with the homologous antigen used in ELISA, and then tested again in 
the same ELISA a titer reduction of 50% or more could be seen (Fig. 5). 
Preincubation of the same positive sera with one of the other filovirus antigens 
(heterologous antigen) did not show a decrease of the titer (Fig. 5). Blocking assays 
were also performed in Western blot analyses. Preincubation of positive sera with 
the homologous antigen resulted in a loss of detection of the viral proteins, whereas 
preincubation with the heterologous antigen did not (data not shown). These data 
show that the detected antibodies are directed to specific filovirus antigens and not 
caused by antigenic cross-reactivity to other known or unknown agents.

Discussion 
Up to the end of 1989, filoviruses were believed to originate from the African 
continent exclusively. There are several reports, based on IFA assays, on the 
occurrence in various African populations of a considerable percentage of human 
sera positive for filovirus antibodies [14, 17, 19, 37, 40]. Similar findings in human 
sera from other continents are not known. Monkeys, on the other hand, especially 
those of the species Cercopithecus aethiops, had been identified as the source of 
infection in the case of the MBG outbreak from 1967 but regarding the high 
pathogenicity of the virus they were not believed to constitute the animal reservoir 
[35, 38]. Earlier findings of MBG-positive monkey sera of African and Asian origin 
[20, 21] could not be confirmed [36]. 
This situation has changed since October 1989, when a new filovirus (RES), 
antigenically related to EBO, was found in specimens of monkeys of the species 
Macaca fascicularis of Javanese origin, which suffered from hemorrhagic fever 
after their importation to the USA [4, 16]. Since this time it has become evident, 
52 
that filovirus infections - probably with a lower pathogenic potential [4] - may also 
be present in wild caught subhuman primates from Asia. 
In the present report 120 sera from various monkey species of African, Asian 
and unknown origin were tested for the presence of filovirus antibodies, and a 
considerable proportion (43.3 %) showed reactivity not only with RES antigen but 
also with EBO and MBG antigens. The reactions of monkey sera to filovirus 
antigens are characterized by the absence of antibodies against the GP and L 
protein. Reactions to the NP are frequent and especially VP40, VP35 and VP30 are 
heavily stained in Western blot analyses. Absence of reactivity to the GP may be 
due to the high degree of glycosylation of this protein and might be also attributed 
to the fact that the virus strains used for antigen preparation were certainly not 
identical with the viruses which had caused the antibody production in these 
animals. Similar patterns of reactivity are also encountered in some of the human 
MBG convalescent sera (Fig. 4). It has to be pointed out that serum titers to 
filoviruses in monkey sera are relatively low as compared to human convalescent 
sera. In earlier studies (Slenczka, unpublished) on monkey sera of African origin, 
this observation had led to the conclusion that these sera were not considered to be 
seropositive. However, the lower titers of monkey sera might again reflect the 
situation of antigenic differences between the strains used for antigen preparation 
and the virus strains causing the antibody production. In addition the low titers 
might also reflect antigenic differences between IgG of monkey and of human 
origin in regard to the specificity of the second antibody (rabbit anti-human IgG) 
used in ELISA and Western blot analyses. The occurrence of antibodies directed 
against filoviruses in Macacae mulattae imported from China would support the 
findings of RES-infected monkeys imported to the United States from the 
Philippines [16] and suggest that filoviruses are spread more widely over the world. 
The suspicion that infections with filoviruses or with antigenically related 
viruses may be common in subhuman primates will have to be proved by efforts for 
virus detection using the polymerase chain reaction or virus isolations and by 
studies on the route of virus transmission in these animals. 
Our findings of serological reactions to filovirus antigens or related viral 
antigens in human sera from central Europe raises several questions. Such 
reactivities have not been recognized in earlier studies, in which sera from the 
normal population were included as negative controls. In previous studies with 
MBG convalescent sera from 1967 we have regularly observed cross-reactivities 
with EBO antigens; however, sera from 120 human controls did not react with 
either antigen (Slenczka, unpublished). In these experiments SDS was not included 
in the antigen preparation. The denaturation of the antigens by SDS may uncover 
different (originally covered) epitopes which are unaccessible in the native protein 
and lead to positive reactions. On the other hand, a considerable proportion of the 
recently identified filovirus sera have also shown a positive reactivity in IFA where 
acetone-fixed preparations were stained and no SDS was included. 
Cloning and sequencing data of filovirus genomes have revealed an evolution- 
ary relationship of filoviruses to other nonsegmented negative-stranded RNA 
viruses among which they seem to be more closely related to paramyxoviruses than 
to rhabdoviruses [27, 34]. However, an antigenic relationship with any of the 
known paramyxoviruses and rhabdoviruses has never been documented for 
filoviruses. 
Similar to the monkey sera, none of the human sera reacts with the GP and L 
protein of filoviruses. The number of L protein molecules per viron particle is very 
53 
low and was calculated to 46.6 for EBO [10] and 56 for MBG [24]. In addition it 
seems to be low immunogenic, which would also explain the negative reaction of 
the sera to the L protein. Absence of reactivity to the GP is probably due to its high 
degree of glycosylation or the fact that the virus antigens are not identical with the 
virus strains causing the antibody production as already discussed for the monkey 
sera. The fact that the antibody titers of the human sera are relatively low as 
compared to human convalescent sera might be due to the same circumstances. 
Most of the sera detected the NP and the VP40, VP35, and VP30 complex, whereas 
only a few reacted with the VP24. The fact that the majority of antibody-positive 
human sera stains two or more of the virion proteins is hardly compatible with a B 
cell activation of other origin which could lead to false-positive results. 
The blocking assays with either homologous or heterologous antigens were 
performed to prove the specificity of antigen detection. The titer reduction after 
incubation with the homologous antigen and the non-reduction after incubation 
with the heterologous antigen suggest that the reaction is specific for the respective 
filovirus antigen, and that it is not directed against material of cells, which were 
used for virus propagation. In addition, the success of homologous immunoab- 
sorption proves that the observed antibody titers cannot be attributed to a 
hypothetical cross-reactivity with known or unknown agents. If the reactions were 
caused by antigenic cross-reactivity or group-specific reactions one would rather 
expect a titer reduction with the homologous as well as the heterologous antigen. 
As in the case of antibody findings in the monkey sera our results on human 
sera will have to be confirmed by further studies. The expression of virion proteins 
in procaryotic as well as eucaryotic systems is currently under way. These proteins 
can be used to develop more reliable screening tests, especially for field studies. The 
data presented in this report suggest that hitherto unknown filoviruses with 
variable pathogenic potential may be present in many parts of the world, and 
subclinical infections may occur frequently. Studies involving methods for virus 
detection with monoclonal antibodies or the polymerase chain reaction will be 
necessary to uncover the epidemiology and pathogenic potential of these 
infections.
