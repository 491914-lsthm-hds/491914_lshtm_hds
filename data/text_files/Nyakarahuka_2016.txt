Abstract
Background: Ebola and Marburg virus diseases are said to occur at a low prevalence, but are very severe diseases
with high lethalities. The fatality rates reported in different outbreaks ranged from 24–100%. In addition, sero-surveys
conducted have shown different seropositivity for both Ebola and Marburg viruses. We aimed to use a meta-analysis
approach to estimate the case fatality and seroprevalence rates of these filoviruses, providing vital information
for epidemic response and preparedness in countries affected by these diseases.
Methods: Published literature was retrieved through a search of databases. Articles were included if they reported
number of deaths, cases, and seropositivity. We further cross-referenced with ministries of health, WHO and
CDC databases. The effect size was proportion represented by case fatality rate (CFR) and seroprevalence.
Analysis was done using the metaprop command in STATA.
Results: The weighted average CFR of Ebola virus disease was estimated to be 65.0% [95% CI (54.0–76.0%),
I2 = 97.98%] whereas that of Marburg virus disease was 53.8% (26.5–80.0%, I2 = 88.6%). The overall seroprevalence of
Ebola virus was 8.0% (5.0%–11.0%, I2 = 98.7%), whereas that for Marburg virus was 1.2% (0.5–2.0%, I2 = 94.8%). The most
severe species of ebolavirus was Zaire ebolavirus while Bundibugyo Ebolavirus was the least severe.
Conclusions: The pooled CFR and seroprevalence for Ebola and Marburg viruses were found to be lower than usually
reported, with species differences despite high heterogeneity between studies. Countries with an improved
health surveillance and epidemic response have lower CFR, thereby indicating need for improving early detection
and epidemic response in filovirus outbreaks.
Keywords: Ebola virus disease, Marburg virus disease, Case fatality rate, Meta-analysis, Systematic review,

Background
Ebola virus disease (EVD) and Marburg virus disease
(MVD) are caused by filoviruses in the family Filoviridae
and are both associated with high case fatality rates
(CFR). The World Health organization (WHO) reports
that the CFR of EVD ranges from 25.0 to 90.0% while
that of MVD ranges from 24.0 to 88.0% [1]. In the early
phases of a major Ebola outbreak in West Africa,
CFR was reported to be 70.8% [2]. The CFR of EVD
seems to be species dependent with Ebola Zaire and
Ebola Sudan species being most pathogenic (with a
reported CFR of 100%), while Ebola Bundibugyo ap-
pears to have a lower CFR at 34% [3]. A recent study
by Lefebvre et al. that used data from WHO database
estimated the CFR of EVD to be 65.4% irrespective of
the Ebola virus species [4]. A few studies have tried
to pool the CFR of EVD and MVD, but did not use
the meta-analysis approach [5].

Although EVD is known to be very severe, there are
some species of Ebola virus that cause less serious dis-
ease. For example, Taï Forest ebolavirus, formerly known
as Côte d’Ivoire ebolavirus, has not been associated with
any fatality and the only case ever reported recovered
from the disease [6]. While there have been some re-
ports of EVD being associated with a CFR of 100%, this
CFR is attributed to only a single case fatality that did
not result into transmission of the virus to other individ-
uals [7, 8]. It seems that CFR differs from species to spe-
cies, however, both Ebola Sudan and Ebola Zaire have
shown a CFR of 100% [1]. Also, the CFR of the MVD
outbreak that occurred in Uganda in 2014 was reported
to be 100%, but again only one person was diagnosed
and died from the disease [9]. The largest MVD out-
break was in Angola in 2004 with CFR of 90% [10] and
in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in 1998 with
CFR of 83% [11].
There is evidence that a substantial proportion of in-
fected humans in Central Africa seem to recover without
being detected by the health care system, and apparently
healthy individuals have been found to be seropositive
for Ebola and Marburg viruses [12–15]. Furthermore,
Marburg virus has been found in apparently healthy
cave-dwelling fruit bats of species rousettus aegyptiacus,
which are believed to be reservoirs for Marburg virus,
and responsible for the spill over into human popula-
tions [16–19]. Because of the variations in the reported
CFR and the presence of seropositive individuals, it is
important to determine the severity and prevalence of
these viral haemorrhagic fevers. This is important for
forecasts and risk analysis especially during outbreaks
for epidemic preparedness and response by affected
countries. This will help to estimate how many infected
people with EVD or MVD are likely to die from the dis-
ease during outbreaks. Whereas there are few studies
that have estimated CFR of EVD [4, 5], these did not use
a meta-analysis approach and no meta-analysis has been
performed on CFR of EVD, MVD, seroprevalence of
Ebola and Marburg viruses. Therefore, our aim was to
determine the overall weighted estimate (effect size) of
the CFR and seroprevalence of EVD and MVD using
available published literature on outbreak reports, WHO
and CDC databases and population based studies for
seroprevalence of filoviruses (Marburg and Ebola vi-
ruses). We also explored whether CFR and seropreva-
lence of these filoviruses differs according to virus
species and country.
Methods
Procedures for systematic reviews and meta-analysis
have been developed to summarize scientific evidence
from the literature. This work was done following the
guidelines published in the PRISMA statement [20]
and MOOSE guidelines for observational studies [21]
as follows.
Literature search strategy
A detailed literature search was conducted by the au-
thors in PubMed (as well as Medline), Web of Science
and Google Scholar until 5th October 2015. In cases
where there was no peer-reviewed publication for a
known outbreak, data was retrieved from websites of
WHO and CDC. The following key words were used;
“ebola”, “ebolavirus”, “viral haemorrhagic fevers”, “mar-
burg virus disease”, “marburg haemorrhagic fever”, “mar-
burg virus outbreak”, “ebola virus disease outbreak”,
“marburg virus”, “ebola outbreak”, “seroprevalence of
ebola virus”, “seroprevalence of marburg virus” and “risk
factors of viral haemorrhagic fevers”. The search in-
cluded all articles and outbreak reports about EVD and
MVD and cross-referencing of primary articles was done
to obtain the original articles. Since the number of out-
breaks of EVD and MVD are known and few, efforts
were made to obtain all information about these out-
breaks from WHO and CDC websites and Ministries of
health of respective countries.
Study selection criteria
Studies were included in the meta-analysis if they re-
ported the total number of cases and total number of
deaths from the outbreak of EVD or MVD. Also studies
that were reporting CFR and sero-prevalence in percent-
ages were included. Studies or reports that did not in-
clude total number of deaths or cases were excluded as
well as studies that did not report original data (Fig. 1).
We also excluded studies that reported outbreaks of
Ebola species that are not pathogenic to humans and
those species that have not caused mortality in humans.
In cases where there were multiple publications, we used
the one with the most complete data or the most recent
one. In cases where there was controversy on the num-
ber of cases and deaths between studies, we cross-
referenced with the respective ministries of health,
WHO or CDC databases to reconcile these discrepan-
cies. Seroprevalence studies included were only those
that were population based and comprised apparently
healthy individuals. We excluded articles that reported
sero-prevalence during outbreaks or in sick individuals.
Data extraction
LN compiled a list of articles and discrepancies were dis-
cussed and resolved by consensus between FM, CK and
JL. We used a standardized data extraction form and the
following information was extracted for each qualifying
study and outbreak report: i) author; ii) Country; iii) num-
ber of cases; iv) number of deaths; v) CFR (if reported); vi)
month and year of outbreak; vii) year of publication viii)

species
involved.
For
population-based
sero-
prevalence studies, the following additional informa-
tion was retrieved: i) sample size and ii) number of
seropositive samples.
Statistical analysis
Data were collected in a Microsoft Excel® spreadsheet
and outcome measures were calculated. CFR was calcu-
lated as number of deaths divided by reported cases
whereas seroprevalence was calculated as number of in-
dividuals seropositive divided by total sample size in
each study. Our effect size (ES), the principal summary
measure, was the proportion represented by CFR and
seroprevalence. We used the newly developed metaprop
command [22] for performing meta-analysis of binomial
data in STATA (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).
The metaprop command was preferred to metan com-
mand because it implements procedures that are specific
to binomial data and is appropriate for dealing with pro-
portions close to or at the margins and also uses the
Freeman-Tukey
double
arcsine
transformations
to
stabilize the variances [22]. The meta-analysis of CFR
was stratified by country and species where possible.
The following parameters were estimated: Cochran’s Q
indicating differences in true ESs, an estimate of the true
variance of ESs between studies (our estimate of τ2) and
Higgins I2 which is an estimate of what proportion of
the observed variance that reflects real differences in ES.
If I2 is close to 0, then almost all the observed variation
is spurious, and there is nothing to explain. If I2 is large,
then reasons for the observed variance should be evalu-
ated [23, 24]. Sensitivity analysis was done by excluding
studies that reported very few numbers or zero deaths
or no seropositives. A meta-regression procedure was
done to assess if factors such as species, country, year
and month of outbreak influence CFR of both EVD and
MVD using the traditional logit-transformation: Logit
(prevalence) = ln [prevalence/ (1 −prevalence)] Variance
(logit) =1/ (np) +1/[n (1 −p)] [25]. The Begg’s and
Egger’s tests were used in combination with a funnel
plot to assess potential publication bias and visualised
using funnel plots [24, 26].
Results
Literature search result
Results from the literature search are illustrated in Fig. 1.
The literature search yielded 7551 articles. Of these, 4898
were excluded as duplicates. After reviewing the titles and
the abstract, only 153 articles were retrieved for detailed
evaluation. After full evaluation of retrieved publications,
72 articles were included in this study. Of those in-
cluded in the study, 23 reported outbreaks of EVD
(Table 1) [3, 8, 27–41, 7, 42, 43], 12 reported outbreaks of
MVD (Table 2) [10, 11, 42, 44–51], 26 reported sero-
prevalence of Ebola virus (Table 3) [8, 12–14, 28, 31,
52–54, 29, 55–70] and 11 reported sero-prevalence of
Marburg virus (Table 4) [14, 15, 57, 61–64, 67, 71–73].
Most of the sero-prevalence studies reported both Mar-
burg and Ebola viruses.
Two more outbreaks have occurred without human
mortalities namely Ebola Reston [74, 75] and another
caused by Taï Forest virus [6]. Zaire ebolavirus spe-
cies was responsible for most of the outbreaks with
14/23 (60.9%) [8, 28, 30–32, 34–36, 39, 40, 41, 37,
76] followed by Sudan ebolavirus with 30.3% (7/23)
outbreaks [27, 29, 38, 7, 42, 77] and lastly Bundibu-
gyo ebolavirus 8.7% (2/23) [3, 42]. Most articles re-
ported DRC (7/23) [8, 28, 32, 39, 40, 42, 76] and Uganda
(5/23) [3, 33, 7, 42] as countries most affected by EVD
outbreaks. Other countries reported include Gabon (4/23)
[31, 34, 36, 78], Republic of Congo (3/23) [35, 37, 41],
South Sudan (3/23) [27, 29, 38] and multiple countries in
West Africa associated with the recent single outbreak
[79–82].

occurred during months of May, June and July and no
outbreaks were reported in the month of February.
Meta-analysis and meta-regression of CFR and
seroprevalence of EVD
The weighted CFR of EVD from 23 outbreaks was 65%
(95% CI: 54–76%) (Fig. 2). There was a substantial
between-study variance indicating heterogeneity in the
overall CFR of EVD, I2 = 97.98%. On stratification by
Ebola virus species, the CFR for Sudan ebolavirus was
53%, Bundibugyo ebolavirus was 34%, whereas that of
Zaire ebolavirus was 75%. From the meta-regression, the
CFR for Zaire ebolavirus was higher compared to other
Ebola species (=0.006, Coefficient = 0.19, 95% CI = 0.063
- 0.588). In sub-analysis analysis by country, the highest
CFR for EVD was observed in Republic of Congo
(89.0%, 84.0–93.0%) whereas the lowest was found in
Uganda (43.0%, 27.0–61.0%) (Fig. 3). However, the
large West African EVD outbreak that affected mul-
tiple countries had an even lower CFR at 40% (39–
40%). The pooled ES for Ebola virus seroprevalence
was 8% [5–11%) with substantial between-study vari-
ance (I2 = 98.7%) (Fig. 4).
Meta-analysis and meta-regression of CFR and
seroprevalence of MVD
The MVD CFR was lower than that of EVD (61%)
(Fig. 5). There was no significant difference between
CFR of MVD and different variables in the meta-
regression model (P = 0.637). The pooled seroprevalence
of Marburg virus was lower than that of Ebola virus at
1.2% (0.5–2%) (Fig. 6).
Publication bias
In the funnel plots, asymmetry was evident which gives
rise to suspected publication bias (Fig. 7). Egger’s test

lence of EVD and MVD (P = 0.001, P < 0.001, p = 0.032,
and 0.046 respectively). However, the Begg’s bias test
was not significant for studies reporting CFR of EVD
and MVD (p = 0.091 and p = 0.293 respectively), sero-
prevalence of MVD (p = 0.95), but was significant for
studies reporting seroprevalence of EVD (p = 0.007).
Discussion
Our findings show that the overall pooled CFR of EVD
of 65% was lower than the previously reported CFR of
90% [83]. This indicates, despite substantial heterogen-
eity, that more than half of the individuals who contract
EVD are more likely to die. Although this CFR appears
to be high, it is lower than the exaggerated figure of
90%. This high CFR tends to cause fear and panic in the
general public and hence interferes with response mech-
anisms [84]. The CFR in our study is similar to that re-
ported by Lefebvre et al. [4], who reported a CFR of 65%
in
a
study
done
using
WHO
database
on
EVD
outbreaks. Although there have been cases of EVD and
MVD with 100% CFR [8, 7], these were isolated single
cases that should not be generalized by scientific com-
munity to consider Ebola and Marburg viruses as highly
virulent diseases with CFR of up to 90%. There have
been reports with a higher CFR than our maximum of
76% [28, 35, 37, 41], but these either happened long time
ago [28] where there was little knowledge about the dis-
ease or happened in very remote places where health
care delivery systems are not robust.
The high CFR of EVD in Republic of Congo (89%)
compared to Uganda (43%) may be due to partly, differ-
ences in health care system and response mechanisms to
outbreaks, but also the severity of the species of Ebola
virus involved. For example, Uganda has developed a
robust surveillance system for detecting these viral
haemorrhagic fevers and epidemic response is started
within hours of a positive diagnosis at a CDC supported
laboratory in the country [85]. The well-established dis-
ease surveillance system and organised health care

delivery in endemic areas might explain the lower CFR for
EVD observed in Uganda. But it is also important to note
that Uganda has been affected by the less pathogenic spe-
cies of Ebola virus (Sudan ebolavirus and Bundibugyo ebo-
lavirus) as compared to DRC and West African countries
that have experienced Zaire ebolavirus Also, it is import-
ant to look at the denominators and numerators when
interpreting the CFR. In this analysis, we see that CFR of
EVD in a large outbreak in West Africa that affected mul-
tiple countries is at CFR of 40% using WHO data, but this
alone would be misleading if the real numbers of deaths
and cases were not looked at. As of 30th March 2016,
there were 11323 deaths and 28646 cases due to EVD
from all countries affected by that outbreak.
Another significant finding of our study was the vari-
ation in the severity and CFR among the pathogenic spe-
cies of Ebola virus. Zaire ebolavirus (CFR, 75%) was
found to be the most severe followed by Sudan ebola-
virus (CFR, 53%), while Bundibugyo ebolavirius (CFR,
34%) was the least severe species. This finding is
supported by McCormick et al., who described differ-
ences in severity and filovirus dynamics [86, 87]. The
reasons for severity of Zaire ebolavirus are unclear, thus
there is a need for further research to determine whether
genetic differences are responsible for the variation in
pathogenesis of these species. There was also heterogen-
eity within Zaire ebolavirus outbreaks (P < 0.001) mean-
ing that these outbreaks, although caused by the same
species are not always similar. The heterogeneity could
further be explained by differences in outbreak investiga-
tion designs or approaches, location of the outbreak and
data collection methods. This is further supported by
the strains that have been found within Ebola Zaire spe-
cies [40]. There was less heterogeneity in outbreak reports
for Bundibugyo ebolavirus and Sudan ebolavirus probably
due to few outbreaks that have been caused by these spe-
cies. However, the meta-regression did not show any influ-
ence on CFR of EVD by country of outbreak (p = 0.249).
This is probably due to low power given the few number
of outbreaks that we have had globally.

With the Metaprop command for meta-analysis of
marginal proportions [22], it was possible to estimate
the 95% confidence intervals for MVD as 61% (32–88%).
The CI was very wide because of the few outbreaks and
the number of cases involved in MVD outbreaks as
compared to EVD outbreaks. Dropping studies with
100% or 0% CFR for MVD, the CFR reduced from 61 to
53%. With few outbreaks of Marburg virus in different
countries, there is a high variation that would impact the
estimation of CFR for MVD, but this was not significant
from the meta-regression (p = 0.913).
We found that apparently healthy individuals in central
African countries, that are endemic for viral haemorrhagic
fevers, had a 5 and 1% chance of having antibodies against
Ebola and Marburg viruses, respectively. This finding sug-
gests that some individuals who get infected with filo-
viruses make a full recovery without severe complications
and being documented by healthcare systems. Although
the sero-prevalence is low, it is important that these sero-
positive individuals are detected early enough because of
greater mortality and socio-economic implications associ-
ated with these infections. Because serological tests have
been reported to have low specificity and there is a lot of
cross-reactivity of filoviruses with other viral haemor-
rhagic fevers [88], this finding should be interpreted with
caution. It is important that specific and more accurate
tests are developed to accurately measure antibody re-
sponse against filoviruses and progress in this direction
has been made due to the recently approved rapid diag-
nostic test for Ebola virus by WHO [89].
The limitation of our ES estimates was the heterogen-
eity that was observed between studies. Efforts to iden-
tify sources of heterogeneity were made, and many
unmeasured factors could have influenced CFR during
outbreaks. These reports had data that were collected
using different methods and hence combining them to
produce one effect was likely to produce high heterogen-
eity. Sensitivity analysis by dropping single cases with
100% mortality did not have substantial impact on the
result. Funnel plots and Beggs tests suggested that publi-
cation bias might have been present, meaning that studies
with negative results about Ebola and Marburg viruses are
less likely to be published hence affecting the estimate of
seroprevalence and CFR for EVD and MVD.
The fact that laboratory tests for Ebola and Marburg
viruses are expensive, used only in specific laboratories
and that serological tests are not specific might influence
the publication of studies done with these tests.
Conclusions
The CFR for Ebola and Marburg viruses is still mod-
erately high but not as high as has been reported in
the media and other publications. The CFR of EVD
and MVD is higher in countries with poor disease
surveillance systems. This calls for an improved sur-
veillance system that will enhance early detection and
response to these filovirus outbreaks to avoid a pan-
demic. The presence of seropositive individuals in ap-
parently health populations indicate that cases go
undetected by the health care system in affected
countries; further calling for robust surveillance for
Ebola and Marburg viruses.
