Abstract
Marburg hemorrhagic fever is rare yet among the most severe diseases affecting humans, with case fatality ratio even
higher than 80%. By analyzing the largest documented Marburg hemorrhagic fever epidemic, which occurred in Angola in
2005 and caused 329 deaths, and data on viral load over time in non-human primates, we make an assessment of
transmissibility and severity of the disease. We also give insight into the control of new Marburg hemorrhagic fever
epidemics to inform appropriate health responses. We estimated the distribution of the generation time to have mean 9
days (95%CI: 8.2–10 days) and standard deviation 5.4 days (95%CI: 3.9–8.6 days), and the basic reproduction number to be
R0 = 1.59 (95%CI: 1.53–1.66). Model simulations suggest that a timely isolation of cases, starting no later than 2–3 days after
symptoms onset, is sufficient to contain an outbreak. Our analysis reveals that Marburg hemorrhagic fever is characterized
by a relatively small reproduction number and by a relatively long generation time. Such factors, along with the extremely
high severity and fatality, support the rare occurrence of large epidemics in human populations. Our results also support the
effectiveness of social distancing measures - case isolation in particular - to contain or at least to mitigate an emerging
outbreak. This work represents an advance in the knowledge required to manage a potential Marburg hemorrhagic fever
epidemic.

Introduction
Marburg hemorrhagic fever is a viral hemorrhagic fever caused
by Marburg virus (MARV), which belongs to the family of
filoviruses along with Ebola virus. After the original MARV
epidemic in West Germany and Yugoslavia in 1967 [1], sporadic
cases were reported in Kenya [2,3], while epidemic outbreaks
were observed in South Africa [4], Democratic Republic of the
Congo [5,6] and Angola, where the most devastating epidemic
took place in 2005 [7,8]. In recent years, one imported case has
also been reported in Colorado, USA [9] and one in The
Netherlands [10]. Despite the relatively low number of outbreaks
in human populations, MARV has largely been identified in both
fruit (Rousettus aegyptiacus) and insectivorous (Rhinolophus eloquens and
Miniopterus inflatus) bats in several areas of Africa [11–13]. In
addition, in 2011 a new genetically distinct filovirus has been
discovered in dead insectivorous bats in Spain [14]. MARV
transmission occurs through direct contact between humans;
however, it is thought to occur also by handling ill or dead infected
animals (mainly monkeys and bats) and human corpses [7].
MARV is among the most virulent pathogens infecting humans,
with case fatality ratio (CFR) even higher than 80% in two recent
outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Angola
[15]. Despite several studies focus on the development of vaccines
and therapies for MARV (see for instance [16,17]; a recent review
can be found in [18]), neither an effective vaccine nor a treatment
for human infections is currently available. In fact, MARV has all
the key features that characterize pathogens posing serious risks for
human populations if used as biological weapons [19].
For the previously mentioned reasons, a possible MARV
epidemic would represent a serious threat for human health and
would pose lots of questions to policy makers in the management
of an outbreak. Consequently, a deeper knowledge of the main
epidemiological determinants of MARV epidemics is crucial to
plan adequate control measures. This study aims to provide
estimates
of
generation
time
distribution
and
transmission
potential and, through the use of a mathematical simulation
model, to assess the effectiveness of social distancing measures in
order to inform appropriate health responses in case of future
MARV epidemics.
Materials and Methods
MARV Natural History and Description of the Analyzed
Data
Marburg hemorrhagic fever presents as an acute febrile illness
which usually progresses to severe hemorrhagic manifestations.
The incubation period is followed by a sudden symptoms onset
marked by fever, chills, headache, and myalgia. After that
a maculopapular rash may manifest, and the individual may
experience nausea, vomiting, chest pain, sore throat, abdominal
pain, and/or diarrhea. The progress of the disease is accompanied
by increasingly severe symptoms and patients often develop severe
hemorrhagic manifestations. The final stages of the disease include

inflammation of the pancreas, severe weight loss, delirium, shock,
liver failure, and multiorgan dysfunction - fatal cases usually have
some form of bleeding, often from multiple sites [7,15].
As reported by the Global Alert and Response updates of the
WHO [15], the 2005 epidemic in Angola was the largest MARV
outbreak documented so far. Since MARV was identified as the
virus responsible for the outbreak by the CDC laboratories on
March 25, 2005, case count was based on the application of
clinical case definition, later supported by on-site laboratories.
However, a retrospective analysis showed that the outbreak
probably started in October 2004. The epidemic accounted for
374 reported cases of which 329 resulted fatal (CFR = 88%) and
spread almost only in Uige region (Northern Angola) [15], which
accounts for about 500,000 individuals [20]. Approximately 75%
of the first 124 identified cases occurred in children aged 5 years or
younger [15]: in 2005, this age group accounted for 26.4% of the
total population of Angola [21], which is characterized by a low
average age and a high fertility rate. The epidemic was declared
over by the Angolan Ministry of Health on November 9, 2005
[15].
As pointed out in the literature [22–24], the shape of the
generation time distribution is essential to evaluate the effective-
ness of individually targeted control measures (e.g. case isolation).
To such aim, we complemented our investigation of the 2005
epidemic by performing a new analysis of the experimental results
on viral load data over time in non-human primates (specifically
on Cercopithecus aethiops) injected by Marburg virus, as reported in
[25].
Estimation Procedure for the Generation Time
The generation time (Tg) is defined as the duration between the
time of infection of a secondary case and the time of infection of its
primary infector. This is equivalent in length to the serial interval,
which represents the duration between the time of symptoms onset
of a secondary case and the time of symptoms onset of its primary
infector.
The distribution of Tg is strongly related to the infectiousness
over time of infected individuals. We assume a direct proportion
between viral load and infectiousness, as already suspected for
MARV [26]; thus we model the latter as a function k(s) depending
on the time elapsed from the end of the latent period s. This
assumption, largely adopted in the literature (see e.g., [22–24]), is
a more biologically sound hypothesis than assuming constant
infectiousness over the entire infectivity period. The average
generation time is given by the mean latent period plus
Ð
sk(s)ds.
By fitting a gamma distribution with offset (to account for the
latent period) to the average viral load over time since the time of
infection [25], we obtain latent period estimate of 3 days, average
Tg estimate of 13.9 days (95%CI: 12.7–17 days) and standard
deviation 7.5 days (95%CI: 5.5–11.4 days). The above Tg
estimates, however, do not account for disease related mortality
which can not be disregarded to obtain reliable estimates for
highly lethal diseases, like Marburg hemorragic fever. To correct
Tg estimates, we adopt the following procedure: first, by randomly
sampling from the observed values of viral load over time, we
generate different individual profiles of infectiousness over time (by
fitting a gamma distribution with offset); second, we assume that
only the fraction (1{CFR) of MARV infected survive to the peak
of the viral load, and thus we weigh the values of the decaying
phase of the infectiousness profiles over time by the factor
(1{CFR). Finally, the resulting average infectiousness profile is
normalized in such a way that the sum of all elements is equal to
one: this corresponds to the probability density distribution of Tg.
Estimation Procedure for the Basic Reproduction Number
The basic reproduction number (R0) is defined as the number of
new infections generated by one infective individual during the
entire period of infectiousness in a fully susceptible population
[27].
R0 for the 2005 outbreak in Angola can be estimated as
R0~1= Ð ?
t~0 e{rtw(t)dt, where w is the probability density
distribution of Tg and r is the exponential growth rate of the
epidemic, i.e. the growth rate of the cumulative number of MARV
infections observed during the early phases of the 2005 epidemic
in Angola, when no intervention measures were enacted and the
depletion of susceptible individuals was negligible.
Details on the derivation of the equation for R0 can be found in
[28]. The same technique was already applied, for instance, to the
analysis of epidemic outbreaks caused by Ebola virus [29], for the
2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic [30,31], for historical influenza
records [23,32,33] and for the analysis of the output of model
simulations [22,24,34,35].
Simulation Model
We propose a mathematical simulation model to evaluate the
effectiveness of different containing/mitigation measures for
MARV epidemics. The adopted model is a discrete time stochastic
Markov chain, where individuals are explicitly represented to
account for individual variability of infectiousness over time.
The
possible
epidemiological
status
of
an
individual
is:
susceptible, infected, recovered and dead. At each time step of
the simulation Dt~1 day, each susceptible individual i is exposed
to the same force of infection li and has a probability pi~liDt of
becoming infected; the force of infection at time t can be written as
li(t)~ PN(t)
j~1 bkj(t{tj)Ij(t)=N(t), where N(t) is the number of
(alive) individuals at time t; b is the transmission rate; kj(s) is the
infectiousness of individual j, s days after infection; tj is the time at
which individual j became infected; Ij(t) is 1 if individual j is
infectious (not isolated, see next section) at time t, 0 otherwise.
An individual infectiousness profile over time kj(s) is assigned to
each infected individual by randomly choosing from the different
individual
infectiousness
profiles
as
obtained
by
randomly
sampling from the fitted values of viral load over time. When an
individual reaches the peak of her/his infectiousness, she/he has
a probability of death equal to the CFR. Therefore, the individual
can either be removed from the simulation or to progress to the
recovered class when her/his infectiousness approaches zero.
Description of Social Distancing Strategies
The main social distancing measure considered in this study is
the isolation of infective cases. Specifically, we assume that each
infected individual is not isolated for a certain time since symptoms
onset (incubation and latent periods are assumed to coincide, thus
symptoms onset coincides with the start of infectiousness), and
thereafter she/he has a daily probability of becoming isolated.
When isolated, individuals are assumed to not contribute to the
force of infection. We perform a sensitivity analysis by varying: 1)
first isolation day, that is the minimum time elapsed from
symptoms onset to the first possible isolation day; it accounts for
the time required to recognize a MARV case and to take the
appropriate
decisions;
2)
daily
isolation
probability,
which
accounts for both probability of isolating a MARV case and
isolation efficacy; 3) the overall number of deaths (caused by
MARV infection) in the population before starting the strategy.
We also investigate the effects of another kind of social
distancing measure, which involves the whole population. In
particular, here we consider the possibility of an intensive social

mobilization (as it was the case of the 2005 MARV outbreak in
Angola [7]), in order to inform the general population on the
routes of transmission of the disease and to promote less risky
behaviors,
for
instance
when
contacting
other
individuals,
handling dead animals or human corpses. We model this
behavioral response of the population by assuming a decrease in
the number of potentially infectious contacts and thus a reduction
of the force of infection.
Results
Generation Time
The best parameters of a gamma distribution fit to data on viral
load over time are 2.66 (95% CI: 1.67–4.09) for the shape
parameter and 4.78 (95% CI: 2.73–8.85) for the scale parameter;
the offset of the distribution is 2 days. A comparison between
estimated infectiousness profile and empirical data on viral load
over time is shown in Figure 1A. When we take into account the
case fatality ratio (88%, as resulting from the analysis of the
outbreak in Angola; see Table 1), the estimated average Tg is 9
days (95% CI: 8.2–10 days), with standard deviation of 5.4 days
(95% CI: 3.9–8.6 days); the shape of the distribution is shown in
the subpanel of Figure 1A. We estimate that MARV infections
result in a fatal outcome a median of 7 days (range, 5–9 days) after
symptoms onset.
We also perform an alternative analysis where we assume that
death probability is directly proportional to the viral load (instead
of assuming death to occur at the peak of viremia). In these new
experiments we estimate the generation time to be on average 9.3
days (95% CI: 3.7–14.6 days) and that infections result in a fatal
outcome a median of 9 days (range, 0–56 days) after symptoms
onset.
Basic Reproduction Number
MARV notification data in Angola reported to the WHO [15]
show a clear exponential growth phase in March-April 2005; we
estimate the intrinsic growth rate of the epidemic in that period,
when social mobilization was not promoted yet, to be 0.056
days{1
(95% CI: 0.0508–0.0612 days{1), which results in
a doubling time of 12.4 days (95% CI: 11.3–13.6 days), see
Figure 1B. The resulting estimate of the basic reproduction
number is R0~1:59 (95% CI: 1.53–1.66); see the inset in
Figure 1B. A summary of the estimated epidemiological param-
eters is reported in Table 1.
Baseline Scenario
Given our estimates of generation time/infectiousness profile,
basic reproduction number, and CFR during the 2005 MARV
epidemic in Angola, we are able to simulate the spread of a MARV
epidemic. Model simulations reveal a possible devastating impact
of an uncontrolled MARV epidemic spreading in a fully
susceptible population, with a final attack rate of 48.1% (95%
CI: 47.4%–48.9%) of the population and a cumulative number of
deaths caused by MARV infections of 42.3% (95% CI: 41.8%–
42.9%) of the population; the peak day incidence is expected to be
on average 0.776% (95% CI: 0.735%–0.822%) with an average
peak day percentage of deaths of 0.685% (95% CI: 0.648%–
0.726%). On the other hand, the probability of experiencing an
epidemic outbreak when one infected individual is introduced in
a fully susceptible population is quite low: in 45.5% of the
simulations the final attack rate is much lower than 0.1% of the
population; in a population of 100,000 individuals, the peak day
would occur on average at day 167 (95% CI: 141–209), while the
peak day for the MARV deaths results delayed of a few days: on
average it is expected on day 177 (95% CI: 150–220). Such a high
variability in the epidemic timing is mainly determined by the high
stochasticity in the transmission process in the early phase of the
epidemic. Results are shown in Figure 2A and B.
However, such kind of ‘‘uncontrolled’’ epidemics are unlikely: in
fact, social distancing measures, either enacted by public health
authorities or spontaneously driven by the reaction of the
population to an ongoing epidemic, would be performed with
Figure 1. Generation time and reproduction number. A Average (red dots) and minimum/maximum (vertical black lines) viral load (measured

quantile of the estimated basic reproduction number distribution.

a non negligible impact. In particular, as observed during the 2005
MARV outbreak in Angola, after an initial phase characterized by
uncontrolled
spread in the population, an intensive social
mobilization occurred [7]. By assuming a population of 500,000
indviduals, as in Uige region [20], the agreement between model
simulations and the data on the 2005 MARV epidemic is excellent
in the early, exponentially growing, phase of the outbreak (see
Figure 2C). Subsequently, a sudden decline in the growth rate is
reported in the data, probably determined by the enacted social
mobilization [7], uncompliant with model simulations of un-
controlled
epidemics.
By
assuming
isolation
of
cases
(see
Figure 2C), model simulations are in good agreement with the
observed data for the whole course of the epidemic – all data lie in
the 50% CI of model predictions. We remark that parameter
values used to produce results shown in Figure 2C are merely
illustrative, as several sets of parameters lead to a satisfactory
model fit.
Social Distancing Strategies
The effects of simulated social distancing measures depend on
three parameters: first isolation day, daily isolation probability,
and cumulative number of MARV deaths in the population before
starting to perform the strategy. As expected, the overall number
of MARV deaths in the population before enacting the case
isolation strategy has a statistically significant correlation only with
the probability of observing a major outbreak. On the other hand,
both daily isolation probability and first isolation day have
a significant impact on all other epidemiologically relevant
quantities such as, for instance, cumulative number of cases/
deaths, peak daily incidence and timing of the epidemic (see
Figure 3A). Therefore, we focus our investigation on the
evaluation of the effects of these two parameters.
Model simulations show that, if timely performed, case isolation
is sufficient to contain a MARV outbreak (results are reported in
Figure 3B). In particular, our analysis reveals that even low daily
isolation probabilities (around 20%), if combined with first
isolation day no larger than 2–3 days after symptoms onset, can
drastically reduce the impact of the epidemic: the cumulative
number of MARV deaths drops from 42.3% to less than 0.05% of
the population. This is shown in more detail in Figure 3C, where
we assume a daily isolation probability of 20%. Our results suggest
that MARV epidemics can be contained if the first isolation day is
less than 4 days; late interventions are not sufficient to interrupt
the chain of infections and thus are able only to mitigate the
epidemics. Remarkably, when isolation of cases occurs early in the
individual course of the disease, the total number of isolated cases

in the population is very low, with peak incidence of isolated cases
of less than 2 per 10,000 individuals; therefore, the burden for the
public health system would be moderate.
Figure 3D shows the possible effects of a behavioral response of
the population (e.g., the avoidance of behaviors favoring disease
transmission or the limitation of the exposure to environments/
contexts highly suitable for MARV transmission). Model simula-
tions suggest that a reduction of potentially infectious contacts of
about 20% is sufficient to interrupt the chain of infections and thus
to contain the epidemic, even if the first isolation day is larger than
3 days.
Age–specific Susceptibility to Infection
Data on the first 124 identified cases show that about 75% of
the infections occurred in individuals aged 5 years or younger [15],
while the fraction of individuals of that age in Angola in 2005 was

26.4% [21]. This suggests the possibility of an existing pattern of
susceptibility to infection by age. Therefore, similarly to what was
done in [35,36] for influenza, we divided the population in two age
groups: children aged 5 years or younger and the rest of the
population; the latter is assumed to be less susceptible to the
disease of a factor x. Then we parameterize this new version of the
model (having two unknown parameters: the transmission rate and
x) in such a way that the doubling time of the simulated epidemics
is the same as observed during the 2005 outbreak in Angola and
that the proportion of cases aged 5 years or less accounts for 75%
of the total number of infections.
We found that children are 14.9 times more susceptible to the
disease than adults. Model simulations accounting for age–specific
susceptibility to infection predict a similar timing of the epidemic,
while they predict a much lower overall number of infections
(24.6%, 95%CI: 24%–25.3%). Nonetheless, even if the values of
the attack rate are largely different, the impact of the social
distancing measures analyzed in this study is exactly the same in
terms of percentage variation of the final epidemic size and
number of deaths (see for instance Figure 4A).
Exponentially Distributed Latent and Infectious Periods
In the scientific literature it has been shown that knowing the
average value of the generation time is sufficient to reconstruct the
timing of an epidemic (see for instance [35–39]). On the other
hand, in order to evaluate the effectiveness of individually targeted
control strategies such as isolation of cases, antiviral treatment and
prophylaxis, the shape of the distribution of the generation time is
crucial [22–24,40]. In this section we show the differences between
assuming our data–driven distribution of the generation time with
respect to the assumption that both latent and infectious period are
exponentially distributed, as in classical mathematical models [27].
In the latter case, we used the best available estimates of latent and
infectious period as given in the literature on Marburg virus [41].
In [41], by fitting the epidemic curve of MARV cases during the
epidemic in Angola and considering that the outbreak started in
October 2004, the author estimates exponentially distributed
latent and infectious periods having mean 6.5 days and 3 days
respectively. Such values lead to a generation time of 9.5 days,
which is in excellent agreement with the value of 9 days (95% CI:
8.2–10 days) found in the current study by analyzing viral load
data in non-human primates. Despite the excellent agreement on
the average value of the generation time, assuming different Tg
distributions results in remarkably different effectiveness of case
isolation strategies, though the value of R0 we used is the same in
both scenarios (see Figure 4B). In particular, when latent and
infectious periods are assumed exponential, only very quick
identification and isolation of cases lead to a remarkable reduction
in the number of avoided deaths.
Discussion
In this work we estimated MARV generation time distribution
and transmission potential. We estimated an average generation
time of 9 days (95% CI: 8.2–10 days) and that the deaths caused
by MARV infections occurred a median of 7 days (range, 5–9
days) after symptoms onset: the latter value is slightly longer than
what was observed in MARV hospitalized (human) cases in the
Angola outbreak. In particular, the WHO reports that most deaths
have occurred between 3 to 7 days after the onset of symptoms
[42], which is in agreement with the findings of [7], where most of
MARV fatal outcomes occurred around day 5 from symptoms
onset. Moreover, our estimate of a long tail of infectiousness in
MARV cases who survive to the infection is supported by the
Figure 4. Effectiveness of social distancing strategies under alternative hypotheses. A Solid lines represent the final number of deaths
(percentage of the population, scale on the left axis) as a function of the first isolation day. Dashed lines represent the percentage variation of the
final number of deaths with respect to simulations not considering interventions (scale on the right axis). Red and cross refers to the baseline scenario
(assuming the same level of susceptibility to infection in all individuals and time–variable viral load); green and circles refer to simulations where age–

results reported in [4], where the authors have observed positive
MARV viral load 32 days after hospitalization. By relaxing the
hypothesis that in MARV infected individuals death would occur
at the peak of viremia and instead assuming that death probability
is directly proportional to the viral load, we obtained a consistent
value for the average generation time, namely 9.3 days (95% CI:
3.7–14.6 days), even if the variability became much larger.
Moreover, we estimated that among individuals who die, the death
occurs a median of 9 days (range, 0–56 days) after symptoms onset.
According to this alternative assumption we estimated a range for
fatal outcomes much closer to that observed during the Marburg
hemorrhagic fever outbreak occurred in the Democratic Republic
of the Congo in 1998–1999, where the estimated range was 0–70
days [43].
We estimate the basic reproduction number in the 2005 MARV
epidemic in Angola to be 1.59 (95% CI: 1.53–1.66), in good
agreement with the estimate of 1.62 (95%CI: 1.6–1.64) given in
[41], which has been obtained by analyzing the same outbreak.
Moreover, our estimate lays in between the estimates for two
epidemics of another filovirus: the Ebola virus. In particular, R0
was estimated to be 1.83 (SD: 0.06) for the 1995 Ebola epidemic in
the Democratic Republic of the Congo [29], and R0 was estimated
to be 1.34 (SD: 0.03) for the 2000 Ebola epidemic in Uganda [29].
In addition, we estimated that children aged 5 years or younger
were about 15 times more susceptible to infection than the rest of
the population. This pattern is opposite to that observed in the
second largest outbreak previously recorded, which occurred in
the Democratic Republic of the Congo, were only 8% of cases
were aged less than 5 years [15]. This suggests that the high
susceptibility to infection we found in children is mainly due to
human behaviors rather than to biological processes. However, the
data we used to estimate the age–specific susceptibility to infection
are quite uncertain and refer only to the first phase of the
epidemic. Moreover, the unusual age distribution (75% of cases
aged 5 years or younger) may imply unusual circumstances - either
biased surveillance or atypical exposure route (e.g. needle sharing
in a pediatric ward) - difficult to account for.
Model simulations are consistent with the data observed in the
2005 MARV epidemic in Uige region, Angola. Our results suggest
that, in order to reduce the impact of an epidemic, crucial factors
are: i) timely detection of cases that can be obtained by applying
clinical/epidemiological case definitions (and possibly supported
by to on-site laboratory diagnosis [44]); and ii) massive social
mobilizations (e.g., through information campaigns on risks and
transmission routes of the disease). In particular, our analysis
shows that a timely isolation of cases (starting no later than 2–3
days after symptoms onset, 20% daily probability of isolation) is
sufficient to contain a MARV epidemic with an affordable burden
for the health system. Thus, it represents a suitable intervention
even
when only
low
resources are
available.
Despite the
effectiveness of social distancing strategies in controlling MARV
outbreaks, the development of both vaccines and therapies is still
crucial in order to limit the number of cases/deaths and to
remarkably reduce disease severity and CFR.
Certainly, the availability of new data on MARV virology and
epidemiology would be key for improving estimates of both
generation time and reproduction number, and for better
evaluating the effectiveness of control measures. In fact, the
reduced data availability led us to introduce several approxima-
tions in our analysis, which have to be considered as study
limitations. First of all, the epidemiological data on the 2005
MARV epidemic in Angola we analyzed [15] come from
a secondary source of data, of which, we cannot vouch for the
quality of. For instance, the adopted case definition and whether it
was uniformly used through the whole course of the epidemic is
unclear. Another open question is how surveillance was performed
early in the outbreak, in fact the dataset is only partial:
a retrospective analysis showed that the outbreak probably started
in October 2004, while the first entry in the analyzed dataset dates
March 2005. This suggests that, especially at the beginning of the
outbreak, the actual case count could have been highly inaccurate.
However, despite this lack of knowledge on the first phases of the
epidemic, since the cumulative number of cases shows a clear
exponential growth rate in March–April 2005, we are able to
estimate the epidemic doubling time. Second, we assume that
infectiousness over time is directly proportional to viral load.
Unfortunately, given the scarcity of virological and epidemiolog-
ical data, this assumption, though common to other studies on
infectious diseases (see for instance [22–24,40]) and more bi-
ologically sound than assuming constant infectiousness over time,
is difficult to validate. Third, given the lack of data on viral load in
human infections, we estimated infectiousness profiles over time,
and thus generation time distribution, by analyzing data from
a study on non-human primates. This assumes that the basic
mechanism regulating within- and between- host dynamics of
MARV in different primate species are similar, for instance in
terms of disease severity, pathology, or kinetics of immune
response. However, as we are interested in estimating the shape
of the density distribution
rather than absolute
values
of
infectiousness over time, this would partially reduce the differences
between species. Moreover, despite the fact that our estimate is
based on the analysis of data in non-human primates, we found an
average value of the generation time which is in remarkable
agreement with that previously estimated in [41] through model fit
to the cumulative count of MARV (human) infections in 2004–
2005 in Angola. Moreover, since no precise information is
available, we made a simplifying hypothesis: we assume that
latent and incubation periods coincide. Another important point is
that the analyzed data on viral load in non-human primates were
collected in 2001, before the Angola strain of Marburg virus was
discovered and there is evidence in monkeys that the pathogenic-
ity, and thus likely the profile of viremia, from the Angola strain
varies relative to other strains [45,46]. This may explain why our
estimates on the time lasting from onset of symptoms to death are
in good agreement with the findings obtained by analyzing the
Marburg hemorrhagic fever outbreak occurred in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo in 1998–1999 [43], while they are slightly
longer than those observed in the Angola epidemic [7]. Clearly
this poses questions both in terms of whether modeling basis is
appropriate and how extrapolatable the results are to outbreaks of
other strains of Marburg virus. Given the lack of empirical data,
which calls for new studies, answers to these questions are difficult
to obtain. However, despite all the mentioned limitations mainly
deriving from the type, amount and quality of the available
empirical epidemiological/virological data, our estimates appear
consistent with the scientific literature on Marburg hemorrhagic
fever [4,7,41,43].
In conclusion, our analysis reveals that Marburg virus is
characterized by a relatively small reproduction number and by
a relatively long generation time. Such factors, along with the
extremely high MARV severity and fatality, represent a possible
explanation of the rarity of large outbreaks in human populations.
Moreover, we estimated the shape of the generation time
distribution, which is essential for the evaluation of the effective-
ness of individually targeted intervention strategies. Our results
also support the effectiveness of social distancing measures
especially of case isolation to contain or at least to mitigate
a MARV epidemic outbreak. Such findings are in agreement with

the general idea that infectious diseases characterized by low
transmission potential and intense symptoms are the easiest to
control [47]. Nonetheless, given their extremely high severity and
fatality, an epidemic caused by MARV, as well as by other
filoviruses like Ebola virus, would represent a serious threat for
human health, especially in the absence of treatment and
prophylactic measures.
