Sierra Leone in West Africa is in a Lassa fever– 
hyperendemic region that also includes Guinea and Li-
beria. Each year, suspected Lassa fever cases result in 
submission of ≈500–700 samples to the Kenema Govern-
ment Hospital Lassa Diagnostic Laboratory in eastern Si-
erra Leone. Generally only 30%–40% of samples tested 
are positive for Lassa virus (LASV) antigen and/or LASV-
specific IgM; thus, 60%–70% of these patients have acute 
diseases of unknown origin. To investigate what other ar-
thropod-borne and hemorrhagic fever viral diseases might 
cause serious illness in this region and mimic Lassa fever, 
we tested patient serum samples that were negative for 
malaria parasites and LASV. Using IgM-capture ELISAs, 
we evaluated samples for antibodies to arthropod-borne 
and other hemorrhagic fever viruses. Approximately 25% 
of LASV-negative patients had IgM to dengue, West Nile, 
yellow fever, Rift Valley fever, chikungunya, Ebola, and 
Marburg viruses but not to Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic 
fever virus.
T
he West African country of Sierra Leone is located in 
a Lassa fever–hyperendemic region that also includes 
Guinea and Liberia. The causative agent of Lassa fever is 
Lassa virus (LASV), a member of the Arenaviridae family. 
Lassa fever is a severe, often fatal, hemorrhagic illness; the 
virus causes 100,000–300,000 infections and 5,000 deaths 
each year in the region (1).
In 2002, Sierra Leone emerged from a brutal 11-year 
civil war that left the country with little infrastructure and 
much of its formal economy destroyed. Today Sierra Le-
one is undergoing substantial economic growth; however, 
poverty, unemployment, and inadequate health care remain 
major challenges. Through the Mano River Union–Lassa 
Fever Network, a variety of organizations are building di-
agnostic capacity for Lassa fever that will lead to better un-
derstanding of the disease and its treatment (2–5). These 
scientific efforts are centered in eastern Sierra Leone at the 
Kenema Government Hospital (Kenema, Sierra Leone) 
within the Lassa fever–hyperendemic region (Figure). The 
Lassa Fever Ward, a 16-bed facility on the hospital grounds, 
is dedicated to treating patients suspected of having Lassa 
fever and is supported by the Lassa Diagnostic Laboratory.
Each year, suspected Lassa fever infections result in 
submission of ≈500–700 samples to the Kenema Govern-
ment Hospital Lassa Diagnostic Laboratory (J. Bangura, 
unpub. data). Samples come from throughout the Lassa 
fever–hyperendemic region and initially are screened for 
malaria by thick blood smear and, if negative, are tested 
for LASV. LASV infection is determined by the presence 
of virus detected by an antigen-detection ELISA and by 
the presence of IgM determined by using an IgM-capture 
ELISA. Generally only 30%–40% of samples tested are 
positive for LASV antigen and/or LASV-specific IgM; 
therefore, 60%–70% of patients have acute diseases of 
unknown origin. We investigated what other arthropod-
borne and hemorrhagic fever viral diseases might be 
causing serious illness in the region and confounding the 
diagnosis of Lassa fever. We tested samples from these 
patients using IgM-capture ELISAs to virus pathogens 
that could occur in the region and mimic Lassa fever. We 
tested for IgM to dengue virus (DENV), West Nile vi-
rus (WNV), yellow fever virus (YFV), Rift Valley fever 
virus (RVFV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Ebola virus 
(EBOV), Marburg virus (MBGV), and Crimean-Congo 
hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV). Follow up analyses 
included IgG ELISAs and/or confirmatory plaque-reduc-
tion neutralization tests (PRNTs). This study provides 
a better understanding of the differential diagnoses for 
Lassa fever in the region, which can lead to improved di-
agnostic capability and disease treatment.

Materials and Methods
Patient Samples
Blood samples collected during October 2006–Octo-
ber 2008 from patients with suspected Lassa fever were 
submitted to the Lassa Diagnostic Laboratory. Most sam-
ples were from acutely ill patients from eastern Sierra Le-
one; some were submitted from Liberia and a few from 
Guinea. Samples were from patients whose illness met a 
surveillance case definition for Lassa fever (Table 1) and 
were processed as described elsewhere (5). Samples that 
were malaria negative by thick blood smear and were from 
patients whose illness failed to respond to antimicrobial 
drugs were initially tested in the Lassa Diagnostic Labo-
ratory for LASV antigen by antigen detection ELISA and 
for LASV-specific IgM by IgM-capture ELISA. LASV-
negative samples were then tested for IgM to DENV, 
WNV, YFV, RVFV, and CHIKV before being transferred 
to the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious 
Diseases for additional testing for IgM to EBOV, MBGV, 
and CCHFV. IgM-positive samples were tested for IgG by 
ELISA and/or confirmatory PRNT, depending on the vol-
ume of sample available.
Research on human subjects was conducted in com-
pliance with US Department of Defense, federal, and state 
statutes and regulations relating to the protection of human 
subjects, and adhered to principles identified in the Bel-
mont Report (1979) (www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/
guidance/belmont.html). All data were gathered and hu-
man subjects research was conducted under an institutional 
review board–approved protocol (no. HP-09-32).
Antigens and Antiserum
Viruses used in production of ELISA antigenic mate-
rials were the 4 DENVs (DENV-1 Hawaii, DENV-2 New 
Guinea C strain [6,7], DENV-3 H87 strain, and DENV-
4 H241 strain [8]); WNV EG101 strain (9); YFV Asibi 
strain (IgM ELISA) or YFV 17D strain (Connaught) (IgG 
ELISA) (10); CHIKV Indo23574 strain; RVFV ZH 501 
strain (11); EBOV Zaire-76 strain (12); MBGV Musoke 
strain (13); CCHFV IbAr10200 strain (14); and LASV Jo-
siah strain (15). The antigens were prepared and optimized 
as previously described (16). All viruses were propagated 
at Biosafety Level 3 or 4, as appropriate. Briefly, the vi-
ruses were grown in appropriate continuous cell lines un-
til cytopathic effects were observed in 50%–75% of the 
cells. Cell culture supernatants, used in the IgM- and IgG-
capture ELISAs, were clarified by centrifugation, inacti-
vated by treatment with 0.3% β-propiolactone, aliquoted, 
and stored at –70°C. Cell lysates for the IgG sandwich 
ELISAs were produced from virus-infected cell pellets 
that were resuspended, sonicated, clarified, aliquoted, 
and stored at –70°C. Virus-infected cell culture super-
natants and cell lysates were inactivated by γ-irradiation

titrations against virus-specific antibodies. Negative or 
mock antigens, both supernatant and cell lysate, used as 
negative controls, were prepared from uninfected cell 
monolayers as described above.
IgM-Capture ELISA
The IgM-capture ELISAs were performed as described 
elsewhere (17,18). Briefly, 96-well round bottom polyvi-
nyl chloride microtiter plates were coated with diluted goat 
anti–human IgM heavy chain capture antibody overnight 
at 4°C. The capture plates were washed, and then patient 
samples, diluted 1:100, were added and incubated for 1 h at 
37°C. With every assay, we included at least 1 known posi-
tive control serum sample to ensure assay was working. 
and 4 known negative control serum samples were used 
to determine assay cutoff. After washing the plates, the in-
activated cell culture supernatant antigen or mock antigen 
was added, and the plates were incubated for 1 h at 37°C. 
Unlike the other assays that used a single virus strain, the 
DENV IgM ELISA antigen was a mixture of all 4 viruses 
and was recognized by antibodies against each (19). Sam-
ples were tested in duplicate against each virus and mock 
antigen. After the plates were washed, a secondary detector 
antibody (mouse or rabbit polyclonal serum antibody titers 
raised against the target virus) was added, and the plates 
were incubated for 1 h at 37°C. After additional washing, 
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–labeled antidetector species 
antibody (goat anti–mouse IgG, heavy and light chain, or 
HRP-labeled goat anti–rabbit IgG, heavy and light chain), 
was added to the mixture, and the plates were incubated 
for 1 h at 37°C. The plates were washed again, ABTS (2, 
2′ -azino-di[3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonate]) substrate 
was added, and the plates were incubated for 30 min at 
37°C. The optical densities (OD) were determined at 410 
nm in an automated ELISA reader. We determined an ad-
justed OD for each sample by subtracting the average mock 
antigen OD from the average positive antigen OD. For each 
assay, the mean deviation and SD of the adjusted ODs were 
determined for all 4 negative control samples. The cutoff 
of each assay was the mean OD plus 3 SDs rounded up to 
the nearest tenth. This OD was typically 0.2. A sample was 
considered positive if the OD was greater than or equal to 
this OD cutoff.
IgG ELISA
We conducted the IgG ELISAs on selected serum 
samples using a modification of the IgM-capture ELISAs 
described above. Briefly, polyvinyl chloride microtiter 
plates were coated with inactivated cell lysate or mock 
antigen overnight at 4°C (19). To detect RVFV IgG, we 
used a sandwich IgG ELISA; plates were coated with an 
RVFV-specific nucleocapsid monoclonal antibody over-
night at 4°C to capture inactivated cell culture supernatant 
onto the plate surface (1 h at 37°C) (18). Antigen-coated 
plates were washed; diluted patient samples (1:100) were 
added, and plates were incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Samples 
were tested in duplicate against each virus and mock an-
tigen, and we included at least 1 known positive control 
sample and 4 known negative control samples with every 
assay. After the plates were washed, diluted HRP-labeled 
mouse anti–human IgG (Fc-specific) conjugate was added, 
and the plates were incubated for 1 h at 37°C. After again 
washing the plates, ABTS substrate was added, and the 
plates were incubated for 30 min at 37°C, and the absor-
bance at 410 nm was determined. Mathematical calcula-
tions and assay cutoffs were determined as described for 
the IgM-capture ELISA.
PRNT
PRNTs were conducted on selected serum samples as 
described elsewhere (20). Briefly, heat-inactivated serum 
samples were diluted 4-fold from 1:10 to 1:10,240 and 
were tested for their ability to neutralize ≈100 PFU of the 
challenge virus. Each sample dilution was tested in dupli-
cate. Both known positive and negative control serum sam-
ples were included with every assay. Serum–virus mixtures 
were incubated overnight at 4°C and then inoculated onto 
85%–100% confluent monolayers of the appropriate cell 
lines grown in 6-well tissue culture plates. After incubation 
for 1 h at 37°C, a nutrient 0.5%–1% agarose overlay was

added, and plates were incubated at 37°C for the appropri-
ate number of days for the virus, then stained with a second 
overlay containing 4%–5% neutral red; plaques were count-
ed 24–48 h later. To detect a wider range of viruses neutral-
ized by the serum, we recorded the reciprocal of the highest 
serum dilution reducing 50% of the plaque assay dose. A 
titer >10 was considered positive. The virus strains used 
in the PRNT were the same as the strains used for ELISA 
antigen, with the exception of WNV(NY99 strain) (21). In 
addition, the PRNT used the alphaviruses, o’nyong-nyong 
(ONNV), Semliki Forest (SFV), and Sindbis (SINV); and 
the ebolaviruses, Sudan Gulu strain (SUDV) and Taï Forest 
(Cȏte d’Ivoire) virus (TAFV).
Results
We tested serum samples from 253 patients submit-
ted to the Lassa Diagnostic Laboratory during 2006–2008 
for IgM to the arthropod-borne and hemorrhagic fever vi-
ruses of interest (Table 2). Because of limited amounts 
of serum, not all samples were tested for antibodies to 
all viruses. Of the arthropod-borne viruses, the preva-
lence of DENV antibodies (4.3%) was highest, followed 
by CHIKV (4.0%). The prevalences of other viruses were 
<3.0%; WNV, 2.8%; YFV, 2.5%; and RVFV, 2.0% of 
patients tested. No antibodies to the tick-borne virus, 
CCHFV, were found in any samples tested. Antibody 
prevalence to the hemorrhagic fever viruses, EBOV and 
MBGV, were 8.6% and 3.6%, respectively.
Samples positive for IgM and with sufficient volumes 
were tested for IgG. Of the 11 DENV IgM–positive pa-
tients, 6 (2.4% of total) were IgM positive only (Table 2). 
Of the 7 WNV IgM–positive patients, 3 (1.2%) were IgM 
positive only. Of the 10 CHIKV IgM–positive patients, 5 
(2.0%) were IgM positive only. Of the 8 MBGV IgM–pos-
itive patients, 7 (3.2%) were IgM positive only. No IgG 
was detected in the patients identified as IgM positive for 
YFV, RVF, or EBOV. Two patients were IgM positive for 
both EBOV and MBGV; 1 sample neutralized EBOV in 
PRNT and 1 did not. MBGV PRNTs were not possible 
because of a lack of positive control serum samples. No 
IgM-only samples reacted in >1 flavivirus assay. Testing 
of patients with undiagnosed acute febrile illness for an-
tibodies against the 8 viruses suggested a possible cause 
for illness in 25.7% of the patients originally suspected of 
having Lassa fever; of these, 19.4% demonstrated only an 
IgM response, suggesting an acute infection.
Malaria parasites and LASV are known to occur in the 
region, and we excluded samples with evidence of either 
because of our interest in undiagnosed acute febrile illness-
es. However, the sample group was tested for LASV IgG 
to better understand the prevalence of Lassa fever. Of 237 
patients, 25.5% were positive for LASV-specific IgG (data 
not shown). Because of the high number of IgG-positive 
patients, we retested the samples for LASV IgM and dem-
onstrated that 7 (3.0%) of the patients tested had LASV-
specific IgM.
Antibodies detected by ELISA cross-react, especially 
within a genus and particularly for antibodies elicited by 
alphaviruses and flaviviruses. Immunodiagnosis conven-
tionally is confirmed by virus isolation or a rise in PRNT 
titer (22). We did not attempt to isolate viruses because the 
samples were heat inactivated to protect the laboratory per-
sonnel. Confirmation by PRNT ideally uses paired serum 
samples (acute- and convalescent- phase), demonstrating a 
4-fold rise in titer. In our retrospective study, we had only 
acute-phase serum samples, but we performed PRNTs in 
an attempt to clarify the specific viruses causing severe 
disease in this region. Flavivirus-reactive patient serum, 
positive for IgM only, was tested for its ability to neutral-
ize DENV-3, WNV, and YFV. Comparison of neutralizing 
titers could not attribute a specific virus as the cause of dis-
ease, with the exception of YFV (data not shown). Three 
of the 5 YFV IgM–positive serum samples demonstrated 
neutralizing titers to YFV and not to the other flaviviruses 
tested. These serum samples also were not reactive by IgM 
ELISA to any of the other 8 viruses tested. CHIKV-reac-
tive patient serum, positive for IgM only, was tested for 
its ability to neutralize CHIKV, ONNV, SFV, and SINV 
(Table 3). Four of the 5 samples tested neutralized ONNV 
to a greater degree than CHIKV. We found no correlation 
between OD and neutralization titer. Five samples had evi-
dence of IgM against RVFV, none of which had evidence 
of IgG. Of the 3 samples tested for neutralizing antibodies, 
only 1 neutralized RVFV (data not shown). No other bun-
yaviruses were available for comparison.
Comparative PRNTs for the ebolaviruses used EBOV, 
SUDV, and TAFV, all of which are known to have circu-
lated in Africa. Eighteen samples were IgM positive only 
by ELISA. Of these, 14 had sufficient volume for PRNT

against all 3 ebolaviruses (Table 4). Eight of these neu-
tralized EBOV, 7 of which were 4 times more reactive to 
EBOV than to the other ebolaviruses tested. One sample 
was 4 times more reactive to SUDV, and 1 neutralized 
TAFV but only at a 1:10 dilution. Four patient samples did 
not neutralize any of the ebolaviruses tested. We found no 
correlation between ELISA OD and neutralization titer. 
We did not test samples with evidence of MBGV-specific 
IgM by PRNT because no known neutralizing antibody 
was available to use as a control.
Discussion
In West Africa, as in many regions of Africa, infec-
tious disease is part of everyday life. The cause of disease is 
often unknown or incompletely understood because of non-
specific clinical features, lack of diagnostic laboratory sup-
port, or little or no knowledge about disease prevalence in a 
region (23). Within the LASV-hyperendemic region, Lassa 
fever is always possible, but early signs and symptoms are 
similar to those of other viral, bacterial, and rickettsial dis-
eases, which can confound a clinical diagnosis (24). Our 
aim was to investigate other viral diseases that cause acute 
febrile illnesses originally thought be Lassa fever. We in-
vestigated arthropod-borne and hemorrhagic fever viruses 
that were likely to occur in the region. More than 25% of 
the LASV-negative patients had evidence of infection with 
other arthropod-borne or hemorrhagic fever viruses.
Using only retrospective field-collected samples lim-
ited the analysis and thus our conclusions. In a prospective 
study, patients would be sampled during the acute phase 
and again during the convalescent phase of illness. Virus 
isolations, antigen-detection ELISAs, and/or reverse tran-
scription PCR would be attempted on all acute-phase sam-
ples. Testing acute- and convalescent-phase serum would 
enable both IgM and IgG testing and confirm positive re-
sults by a >4-fold increase in neutralizing titer. In this retro-
spective study we had only acute-phase samples; therefore, 
our results can be considered presumptive only.
Because the samples submitted to the Lassa Diag-
nostic Laboratory were from patients with acute illness, 
IgM-capture ELISAs were used to detect the earliest 
 
antibody elicited in response to viral infection. We found 
evidence of IgM for flaviviruses (DENV, WNV, and 
YFV); the bunyavirus RVFV; the alphavirus CHIKV; and 
the filoviruses EBOV and MBGV (Table 2). We tested 
IgM-positive samples for IgG when possible. Most sam-
ples exhibited only IgM or very low IgG levels, suggest-
ing acute-phase disease or the beginning of class switch-
ing (data not shown). Exceptions were the samples that 
had CHIKV antibodies; 6 of the 10 patients had higher 
IgG than IgM against CHIKV, suggesting late acute-
phase or early convalescent-phase infection.
PRNT is the laboratory standard for immunologic as-
says. It measures in vitro virus neutralization and is the 
most virus-specific serologic test to confirm immunologic 
test results. Testing CHIKV-positive serum demonstrated 
that the patients were more likely to have been infected by 
ONNV, a related but separate virus species. The viruses 
can be distinguished genetically by sequence analysis but 
with greater difficulty by serologic testing (25). Antibod-
ies to the 2 viruses are generally distinguishable only by 
PRNT. We demonstrated that the CHIKV ELISA we used 
can detect antibodies to both viruses and confirmed the re-
sults by PRNT (Table 3). Most patient samples that reacted 
in the CHIKV IgM ELISA were ONNV upon confirma-
tory testing in the PRNT (Table 3). PRNT results for other 
viruses provided some additional information but at times 
were incomplete because of limitations of available virus 
strains or appropriate positive controls. We found clear 
evidence for YFV infections in the samples tested, but data 
were incomplete for other flaviviruses. PRNT results for 
RVFV and MBGV infections were similarly inconclusive.

*Patient samples were tested for IgM and IgG reactivity in an EBOV 
ELISA. Samples with IgM only were tested for their ability to neutralize 
specific ebolaviruses, PRNT, plaque-reduction neutralization test; EBOV, 
Ebola virus; SUDV, Sudan Gulu strain; TAFV, Taï Forest (Côte d’Ivoire) 
viruses. 
 
Undiagnosed Acute Viral Febrile Illnesses
PRNT results for the ebolaviruses clearly indicated that 
most resulted from EBOV infections (Table 4). We found 
evidence that SUDV was responsible for 1 infection but 
no evidence for TAFV infection, the only ebolavirus iso-
lated in West Africa. In the ebolavirus PRNTs, we did not 
include the newest discovered ebolavirus, Bundibugyo vi-
rus, which cross-reacts with EBOV in immunoassays (26). 
Ebolavirus infections in Sierra Leone might be the result 
of Bundibugyo virus or an ebolavirus genetic variant and 
not EBOV.
Several arthropod-borne viruses are known to circu-
late in West Africa (23). Using ELISA to look for IgM and 
IgG, we found indication of infections with the flavivi-
ruses DENV, WNV, and YFV; the bunyavirus RVFV; the 
alphavirus CHIKV (shown to be ONNV by PRNT); and 
the filoviruses EBOV and MBGV. Evidence of flavivirus 
infections was not unexpected. DENV, WNV, and YFV 
infections have been reported in Sierra Leone and the sur-
rounding region (23,27–30). CHIKV is thought to be en-
zootic in West Africa, maintained in a sylvatic cycle in-
volving nonhuman primates and Aedes species mosquitoes 
(25). ONNV is a distinct virus species but closely related to 
CHIKV. CHIKV fever is described throughout the region, 
but ONNV disease has not been described in this immedi-
ate region. In 2003, an outbreak of ONNV was reported in 
Cȏte d’Ivoire (31).
RVFV, a bunyavirus in the Phlebovirus genus, is en-
demic to East and South Africa, but may not be estab-
lished in West Africa (32–34). In this study, we found 
evidence of RVFV IgM and confirmation of at least 1 of 
them as neutralizing the virus. CCHFV, another bunyavi-
rus in the Nairovirus genus, circulates in West Africa, but 
we found no evidence of CCHFV infections in any patient 
samples tested (35). The filoviruses represented the larg-
est group of patient samples that reacted in our study. This 
finding was surprising because no filovirus has been re-
ported in the region or in West Africa other than the initial 
isolation of TAFV in Cȏte d’Ivoire (36). These serologic 
results provide evidence that ebolaviruses are circulat-
ing and infecting humans in West Africa. All of the eb-
olavirus-reactive samples demonstrated only IgM and no 
evidence of IgG, suggesting acute infection. PRNT results 
indicated that the infecting virus was most closely related 
to EBOV, except for 1 SUDV-reactive patient sample. 
This finding was unexpected because our assumption was 
that any ebolavirus would more likely be TAFV, the only 
species described in West Africa. Although the serum 
samples were able to neutralize EBOV only at a low level 
(1:40 dilution), it is possible that the virus is an EBOV 
genetic variant. This presumptive diagnosis of EBOV in-
fection extends the ebolavirus geographic region to Sierra 
Leone and the surrounding region. The MBGV-reactive 
samples, similar to the ebolavirus samples, had evidence 
only of IgM, suggesting acute infection. Unfortunately, 
we were unable to determine whether the samples could 
neutralize any MBGV because we were unable to acquire 
a known neutralizing serum to use as a positive control.
Our presumptive results provide some insight into the 
other viruses causing acute disease in the patients whose 
samples were submitted to the Lassa Diagnostic Laboratory. 
Although our results are not definitive, they demonstrate ar-
thropod-borne and hemorrhagic fever viruses that should be 
considered when Lassa fever is suspected. These continued 
studies will add to the body of knowledge for Lassa fever 
and other arthropod-borne diseases and hemorrhagic fevers 
that occur naturally within Sierra Leone and West Africa.
