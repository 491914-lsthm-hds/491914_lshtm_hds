In March 2005, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) investigated a large hemorrhagic
fever (HF) outbreak in Uige Province in northern Angola, West Africa. In total, 15 initial specimens were sent
to CDC, Atlanta, Ga., for testing for viruses associated with viral HFs known to be present in West Africa,
including ebolavirus. Marburgvirus was also included despite the fact that the origins of all earlier outbreaks
were linked directly to East Africa. Surprisingly, marburgvirus was conﬁrmed (12 of 15 specimens) as the cause
of the outbreak. The outbreak likely began in October 2004 and ended in July 2005, and it included 252 cases
and 227 (90%) fatalities (report from the Ministry of Health, Republic of Angola, 2005), making it the largest
Marburg HF outbreak on record. A real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR assay utilized and
adapted during the outbreak proved to be highly sensitive and sufﬁciently robust for ﬁeld use. Partial
marburgvirus RNA sequence analysis revealed up to 21% nucleotide divergence among the previously char-
acterized East African strains, with the most distinct being Ravn from Kenya (1987). The Angolan strain was
less different (7%) from the main group of East African marburgviruses than one might expect given the large
geographic separation. To more precisely analyze the virus genetic differences between outbreaks and among
viruses within the Angola outbreak itself, a total of 16 complete virus genomes were determined, including
those of the virus isolates Ravn (Kenya, 1987) and 05DRC, 07DRC, and 09DRC (Democratic Republic of
Congo, 1998) and the reference Angolan virus isolate (Ang1379v). In addition, complete genome sequences
were obtained from RNAs extracted from 10 clinical specimens reﬂecting various stages of the disease and
locations within the Angolan outbreak. While the marburgviruses exhibit high overall genetic diversity (up to
22%), only 6.8% nucleotide difference was found between the West African Angolan viruses and the majority of
East African viruses, suggesting that the virus reservoir species in these regions are not substantially distinct.
Remarkably few nucleotide differences were found among the Angolan clinical specimens (0 to 0.07%),
consistent with an outbreak scenario in which a single (or rare) introduction of virus from the reservoir species
into the human population was followed by person-to-person transmission with little accumulation of muta-
tions. This is in contrast to the 1998 to 2000 marburgvirus outbreak, where evidence of several virus genetic
lineages (with up to 21% divergence) and multiple virus introductions into the human population was found.
Marburgvirus was ﬁrst identiﬁed in 1967, when infected
monkeys, imported from the Lake Kyoga region of Uganda,
transmitted the virus to laboratory workers and scientists at
facilities in Germany and the former Yugoslavia (56). Mar-
burgvirus and its close relative ebolavirus comprise the family
Filoviridae and are known to cause severe hemorrhagic fever
(HF) in humans and nonhuman primates (38). Marburgvirus is
a single species, consisting of viruses differing from one an-
other by up to 21% at the nucleotide level. In contrast, four
distinct species of ebolavirus (Zaire, Sudan, Reston, and Ivory
Coast) have been deﬁned, which differ genetically from one
another by approximately 37 to 41% (15). Marburgvirus is a
single-strand, negative-sense RNA virus whose seven gene
products are, in order, nucleoprotein (NP), VP35, VP40, gly-
coprotein (GP), VP30, VP24, and the polymerase (L) (14).
Ebola and Marburg HF outbreaks are generally thought to
involve the relatively rare introduction of the virus into the
human population followed by waves of human-to-human
transmission (usually through close contact with infected indi-
viduals or their body ﬂuids), with little if any evolution of the
virus during the course of the outbreak (42, 48). Symptoms of
marburgvirus infection include general malaise, acute fever,
abdominal cramping, bleeding disorders, and shock (29). Case
fatality rates in previous large Marburg HF outbreaks have
ranged from 23 to 83% (5, 30).
Historically, sources of marburgvirus have been conﬁned to
East Africa. They have been centered almost exclusively within
500 miles of Lake Victoria, with the exception of a single case

in Zimbabwe in 1975, when a traveler became infected and,
seeking medical treatment, subsequently transmitted the virus
to a health care worker in South Africa. This previous close
association of marburgvirus with East Africa contrasts with the
observed distribution of ebolavirus, which has caused human
HF outbreaks throughout tropical Africa, ranging from Cote
d’Ivoire to Uganda. The largest Marburg HF outbreak previ-
ously on record occurred from 1998 to 2000 in Durba, Dem-
ocratic Republic of Congo (DRC) (57), infecting 154 people
and with a case fatality rate of approximately 83% (5). The
majority of these patients were involved directly or indirectly
with illegal gold mining activity in the region. The Durba out-
break was somewhat unusual compared to previous marburg-
virus outbreaks in that it continued for almost 2 years, during
which time multiple distinct genetic lineages were found to be
circulating (37), likely indicating several independent introduc-
tions of virus into the human population from the unknown
natural reservoir.
The recent emergence of marburgvirus in West Africa is
described in this report. Based upon clinical presentations that
meet the viral HF case deﬁnition (10), the outbreak likely
started in October of 2004 in Uige Province in northern An-
gola yet continued undiagnosed until March 2005, when trans-
mission of HF to health care workers alerted the community to
the possibility of Marburg or Ebola HF (9, 58). The outbreak
persisted until July 2005 (32), raising the possibility that mul-
tiple genetic lineages could have been introduced during this
long epidemic period. In this study, we sequenced the entire
marburgvirus genomes obtained from multiple laboratory-con-
ﬁrmed cases throughout the Angola outbreak and compared
these sequences to those obtained at different times during the
1998 marburgvirus outbreak in Durba, DRC, as well as the
complete genome of Ravn marburgvirus isolated in 1987. Col-
lectively, these 16 newly derived complete genome sequences,
along with those previously determined for the Popp, Musoke,
and Ozolin strains, afforded us the opportunity to carry out the
most comprehensive survey to date of the sequence spectrum
circulating among marburgviruses. We determined that the
newly emergent Angola marburgvirus is closely related to the
majority of the previous East African isolates.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Specimen processing, antigen capture, IgM and IgG ELISA, virus isolation,
and IHC staining. Blood and serum specimens from suspected viral HF (VHF)
patients were received unfrozen at CDC in International Air Transport Associ-
ation-approved
containers.
Samples
200501377
to
-88,
200501411,
and
200501412 were opened under biosafety level 4 conditions, and virus isolation
using Vero E6 cells was performed as previously described (42). The Angola
marburgvirus reference sample is clinical specimen number 200501379, or
“1379c,” while the virus isolated from 1379c is designated “1379v”. The samples
were inactivated with gamma-cell irradiation or chaotrope for RNA extraction
and then tested for marburgvirus antigen, speciﬁc immunoglobulin M (IgM),
IgG, and nucleic acid by using modiﬁcations of existing techniques for Ebola
hemorrhagic fever (22, 23, 48, 49). The modiﬁcations for the IgM and IgG
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) consisted of (i) a replacement of
the pooled monoclonal antibody mix with one directed to marburgvirus (Musoke
strain) NP and (ii) a replacement of the Vero cell lysates with ones in which Vero
cells were infected with marburgvirus (Musoke strain). The modiﬁcations for the
nucleic acid detection were to use a marburgvirus-speciﬁc quantitative reverse
transcription-PCR (Q-RT-PCR) assay designed to detect all known species of
marburgvirus (described below). Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was per-
formed on skin biopsies ﬁxed in 10% formalin as previously described (60) and
adapted for detection of marburgvirus. Specimens 2005000126 to -998, processed
in the ﬁeld lab, were not gamma irradiated but were treated additionally with
0.5% Triton X-100 and heated at 56°C for 30 min to greatly reduce infectivity.
RNA extraction. RNA was extracted using an Applied Biosystems 6100 nucleic
acid preparation station according to a modiﬁed protocol (49) using noncellular
lysis buffer. Brieﬂy, 50 l of sample was mixed with 300 l of 2 noncellular lysis
buffer under biosafety containment conditions. Following 15 min of incubation,
plastic ware containing samples in lysis buffer was externally decontaminated
with 3% Lysol, and RNAs were transported out of biosafety containment and
extracted according to the manufacturer’s instructions, with the modiﬁcation of
adding two extra 1 noncellular lysis buffer washes at the beginning of the
extraction process.
PCR diagnostic assay. Brieﬂy, a Q-RT-PCR assay was designed to detect a
region in VP40. Q-RT-PCR assays were carried out by ﬁrst random-primed
conversion of the RNA to cDNA using the High Capacity cDNA synthesis kit
(Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Ten micro-
liters of the cDNA synthesis reaction mixture was then used to program probe-
based real-time PCR assays, using Universal Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) in
50-l total reaction volumes. The marburgvirus broadly reactive Q-PCR assay
used the following forward and reverse primers and probe, respectively: 5-GG
ACCACTGCTGGCCATATC-3, 5-GTCGGCAGGAGGIGAAATCC-3, and
6-carboxyﬂuorescein-5-CTCTGGGACTTTTTCIACCCTCAGTTGATGA-3.
The quencher, Black Hole, was internally placed on T indicated by boldface
within the probe oligonucleotide. Ampliﬁcations were carried out for 40 cycles by
denaturing for 20 seconds at 94°C followed by 30 seconds at 60°C degrees.
Samples exhibiting cycle threshold (CT) values of less than 35 were considered
positive. The VP40 gene sequence of the Angola-05 marburgvirus isolate was
determined and allowed development of an Angola-speciﬁc Q-RT-PCR assay.
The slightly modiﬁed primers and probe were 5-GGTCCACTGCTGGCCATA
TC-3, 5-GTCGGCAGGAAGCGAAATCC-3, and 6-carboxyﬂuorescein-5-T
TCTGGGACTTTTTCGACTCTCAGTTGATGA-3, where the quencher was
again internally placed on the T indicated by boldface. The modiﬁed Q-RT-PCR
assay provided two to fourfold (1 to 2 CT units) better sensitivity in samples
assayed side by side with the original assay (data not shown).
Virus passage histories. Ravn isolate (1987), strain M/Kenya/Kitum Cave (20),
was passaged once in SW13 cells, followed by four passages in Vero E6 cells.
05DRC, 07DRC, and 09DRC viruses (Durba, DRC, 1998) were passaged three
times each in Vero E6 cells.
Genome fragment ampliﬁcation and sequencing. The reference sequence,
Ang1379c, was determined from RNA isolated directly from clinical material and
also from the virus isolate (Ang1379v) after one passage on Vero E6 cells.
Multiple RT-PCR fragments were generated using the Superscript III one-step
high-ﬁdelity RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. The fragments, ampliﬁed using the following combinations of primers
(listed 5 to 3) and designed based upon a consensus sequence derived from an
alignment of Musoke, Popp and Ozolin marburgviruses (GenBank ascension
numbers DQ217792, NC001608, and AY358025, respectively), were as follows
(the oligonucleotide names reﬂect the approximate nucleotide position of each
primer): 21F (GACACACAAAAACAAGAGATGATG) and 810R (GAAGTC
CTGAGAATCTAGTTTG), 132F (GTACAAAACCCACTGCCCCTCATG)
and 3489R (AACCGTAGTCCCCTTACTAC), and 5363F (AGAIGGIATGAT
GAAGAAAAG) and 7781R (CAGGTCCIAGCACITTGCATGTTCC), fol-
lowed by nested ampliﬁcation using 5420F (TGAGAAITTICCTTTGAATGGC
TTC) and 7671R (TCCAAGGATTTIGCAGTTTG), 7567F (TGGCCCTGGA
ATIGAAGGACTC)
and
10571R
(AGCATATGAACAATAGATC),
and
10401F (TGTTCCAGAGTGGCAACAAAC) and 14933R (CTCAGAIAAATT
AATCCACTTTAC), followed by heminested ampliﬁcation using 10401F and
14882R (TGTGGCACCAATTAGCCTTTTCCC) and 14763F (TGGACGATG
ATTTATCTGAGTC) and 19113R (GGACACACTAAAAAGATGAAG). The
region between nucleotides 3489 and 5363 was ampliﬁed by using primers
VP35F1 (GCTTACTTAAATGAGCATGG) and GP170R (TGCCCACTCAG
TGTAAATCC). The full-length genome sequences from clinical specimens from
this outbreak (samples 1380, 1381, 1386, 1411, 0126, 0181, 0214, 0215, 0754, and
0998) and isolates 05DRC and 07DRC were similarly determined with primer
modiﬁcations by amplifying six genome fragments, designated A to F, as follows:
fragment A was ampliﬁed with 63F (TGACATTGAGACTTGTCAGTC) and
4997R (GCTTGATTTCCTTCACGC) followed by nested ampliﬁcation using
375F (CAAGAATGCAGATGCAACC) and 4641R (GTTTGCACCGTGGTC
AG); fragment B was ampliﬁed using primers 3781F (GTTCCTCCAGTGATA
AGAGTC) and 8478R (GATTGAAGTAAGGCAAGTTGTTAA) followed by
nested ampliﬁcation using 4155F (CTAACAAAAGGGGTCTAACCTA) and
8304R (CTTAACTATGTCTTCAAGCCTA); fragment C was ampliﬁed using
primers 7567F and 10571R followed by nested ampliﬁcation (sample 1386 only)
using 7621F (TTTITGITGIAGGTTGAGGCG) and 10521R (TTGATCCTTC

AAAGCAACTCC); fragment D was ampliﬁed using primers 10000F (GTACC
TCTAAGGAAAACCATGAAG) and 15460R (GTTGATATAATTGCACGT
GTGG) followed by nested ampliﬁcation using primers 10287F (GACCTCAA
TTCCACAGCA) and 15279R (GTCTGCAGTGCCTTGAGT); fragment E was
ampliﬁed using 14763F and 19113R followed by heminested ampliﬁcation using
14817F (CTAATTTCTTGAGGGCATATTC) and 19113R; and fragment F was
ampliﬁed in a heminested reaction using 3F (CACACAAAAACAAGAGATG
ATG) and 925R (CTCAACGCCTGCTTGAAAG) followed by heminested am-
pliﬁcation using 3F with 801R. The RT-PCR fragments for the Ravn and 09DRC
virus isolates required considerable primer modiﬁcations. Nucleotides 3 to
6000 were generated in four fragments using primers 3F with 721R (ACCTGT
CACCAAATTTACTCC),
617F
(CACTGGCTTACTACAGGCCA)
with
1128R
(TGTTCATGTCGCCTTTGTAG),
818F
(ATTGCATCCACTTGT
GCG) with 2117R (AGACAGGATTTTGGTTATTCC), and 1581F (CACTAA
GGCAAACTCAGGAC) with GP170R. The remainder of the genome was gen-
erated using primers described above, namely, 7567F with 10571R, 10401F with
14882R, and 14763F with 19113R. If necessary, RT-PCR products of the correct
predicted sizes were gel puriﬁed using either the Qiaquick gel extraction kit
(QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) or the NucleoTrap gel extraction kit (BD Biosciences
Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The puriﬁed DNA was sequenced by primer walking
of both strands, using ABI BigDye 3.1 dye chemistry and ABI 3730XL auto-
mated DNA sequencers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Sequencing
primers representing the most conserved regions were designed encompassing
the entire genome fragment. Sequencing primers were synthesized by Integrated
DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Chromatogram data were assembled using
Seqmerge (Accelrys Inc, San Diego, CA), Phred/Phrap base calling and assembly
software, and Consed for sequence editing (University of Washington). The
terminal 20 nucleotides were not experimentally determined but were based on
the termini of the previously published Popp, Musoke, and Ozolin sequences.
Phylogenetic analysis. Genomic analyses and alignments of ﬁlovirus sequences
were performed using the Wisconsin package of GCG version 10.3. (Accelrys
Inc., San Diego, CA). Phylogenetic analysis was performed using Paup 4.0b10
(Sinauer Associates Inc.).
Nucleotide sequence accession number. The GenBank Accession numbers for
the newly determined full-length genome sequences are as follows: Ravn,
DQ447649; 07DRC, DQ447650; 05DRC, DQ447651; 09DRC, DQ447652;
Ang1379c, DQ447653; Ang1381, DQ447654; Ang1386, DQ447655; Ang0126,

RESULTS
Discovery of marburgvirus HF in West Africa. In early 2005,
reports were received by the CDC and World Health Organi-
zation (WHO) of a large HF outbreak in Uige Province in
northern Angola, West Africa (Fig. 1). On 15 March, speci-
mens were collected and sent to CDC in Atlanta, Ga., for
testing for evidence of infection with viruses associated with
VHF which were known to be present in West Africa. To be
thorough, the VHF-associated Marburg virus was also in-
cluded despite the origin of all earlier outbreaks being re-
stricted to East Africa. Testing included virus isolation, antigen
capture ELISA, IgM and IgG ELISA, RT-PCR and Q-RT-
PCR assays, and in one case IHC staining. Contrary to expec-
tations, evidence of acute marburgvirus infection was found in
12 of the 15 initial specimens (Table 1), all of which were from
fatal cases.
Clearly the most sensitive diagnostic test was the Q-RT-PCR
assay, which was designed to detect a conserved sequence of
VP40 present in all known species of marburgvirus, including
the more distantly related Ravn strain. All positive Q-RT-PCR
results were obtained in duplicate, with each set yielding am-
pliﬁcation curves within 0.4 CT units. Virus isolation proved to
be nearly as sensitive as the Q-RT-PCR assay, although limited
clinical material in some cases made virus isolation attempts
difﬁcult. The antigen capture assay conﬁrmed the RT-PCR
results in four cases yet overall proved less sensitive. None of
the initial samples were positive in either the marburgvirus-
speciﬁc IgM or IgG assays performed in parallel. In those
ELISAs, the positive and negative controls in each assay per-
formed as expected, thus suggesting that the negative results
with the human specimens were not the result of any system-
atic errors. In no instances did specimens test positive by an-

tigen capture, IgM, IgG, or virus isolation and not test positive
by RT-PCR (data not shown).
Three samples (samples 1411 to 1413 in Table 1) arrived the
following week. One specimen was a skin biopsy from a patient
in Uige, while the other two samples, 1411 and 1412 (a blood
specimen and a serum specimen, respectively, drawn at the
same time), were from a physician in Luanda with a recent
contact history with the suspected VHF patients in Uige Prov-
ince. The physician traveled directly to the capitol city of
Luanda only days before her death. Both samples tested pos-
itive by Q-RT-PCR and virus isolation, while the skin biopsy
tested positive by IHC staining.
Complete genome sequence determination and phylogenetic
analysis. To establish the genetic relationship of the Angola
marburgvirus relative to prior East African viruses, and to
determine the extent of sequence variation circulating within
the Angola VHF outbreak, complete marburgvirus genomes
were sequenced from 11 clinical samples collected from fatal
cases throughout a time period of almost 3 months and en-
compassing the known geographic distribution of the outbreak.
There were four municipalities within Uige Province from
which virus-positive samples were collected (Fig. 1). The mu-
nicipalities were Uige (samples 1379 to 1386 and 0998),
Songo (sample 0754), Bungo (samples 0181, 0214, and 0215),
and Damba (sample 0126). In addition, we included the sam-
ple from the Angolan capitol, Luanda (sample 1411) (Fig. 1).
RNAs were extracted from multiple types of clinical speci-
mens, including oral swabs, which collectively contained a wide
range of viral loads. It should be noted that following the initial
Marburg VHF diagnosis, ﬁeld labs were established by CDC
and the Public Health Agency of Canada on site in Luanda
and Uige, respectively, at the request of the Ministry of
Health of Angola and WHO. Samples 0126, 0181, 0214,
0215, 0754, and 0998 (Table 2) were obtained and tested
within 24 h of specimen collection and then stored frozen
until nucleotide sequence analysis could be initiated.
To provide a more complete representation of the overall
potential for genetic diversity within a single marburgvirus
outbreak and to provide a basis to which to compare the
genetic diversity (or lack thereof) circulating in the Angola
outbreak, we determined the complete genome sequences of
four marburgvirus isolates obtained from the two most recent
marburgvirus outbreaks prior to the one in Angola. Three of

a The scale for the Q-RT-PCR assay is the same as that described in Table 1,
footnote b, with the caveat that the Q-RT-PCR assay used on samples 0126,
0181, 0214, 0215, 0754, and 0998 had been redesigned, as described in Materials
and Methods, to correct nucleotide mismatches between the primers and probe
to match the Angola-speciﬁc target sequences. The minor modiﬁcations resulted
in a decrease of 1 to 2 CT units for clinical samples tested side by side with the
original (more generic) Q-RT-PCR assay.

the isolates, 05DRC, 07DRC, and 09DRC, were from epide-
miologically unlinked cases that occurred at different times
during the 1998 outbreak in Durba, DRC, while the fourth
isolate, Ravn (Rav), was obtained in 1987 from a 15-year-old
Danish boy with a recent history of travel to Kitum Cave in
Mount Elgon, Kenya, 9 days prior to disease onset.
All 16 newly determined complete marburgvirus sequences
(19,114 nucleotides in length), in addition to those of Popp
(Pop), Musoke (Mus), and Ozolin (Ozo), were analyzed to
determine their phylogenetic relationship (Fig. 2A) and nucle-
otide distances (Fig. 2B). A maximum-likelihood analysis
placed the Angola (Ang) isolates ﬁrmly (100% bootstrap sup-
port) within the clade containing the majority of the East
African isolates. This result was surprising given the large
geographic distance, 1,000 miles, of Uige, Angola, from the
locations of all other known sources of marburgvirus. The
branching pattern of the phylogenetic tree shows ﬁve overall
branches, with the Rav/09DRC branch being the most diver-
gent, showing nucleotide differences greater than 21% relative
to viruses in other lineages, including Ang. 05DRC, 07DRC,
and Ozo comprise a second well-deﬁned lineage, differing from
viruses in all other lineages by greater than 7%. Finally, using
a cutoff of 5% nucleotide difference, Ang, Mus, and Pop
form three additional lineages, with the Angola sequence di-
verging by 6.8 and 7.1% from Mus and Pop, respectively, and
by greater than 7.4% from the Ozo, 05DRC, and 07DRC
lineages. Mus and Pop differ from each other by 5.9%. For
comparison, the difference between any of the marburgvirus
genomes and those of either Zaire ebolavirus or Sudan ebo-
lavirus is greater than 65%, while the Zaire and Sudan ebola-
viruses differ from each other by greater than 40%.
Among the 11 clinical samples selected from the Angola
outbreak, the genetic sequences were well conserved through-
out the entire length (19,114 nucleotides) of the genome (Fig. 3).
Ten of 11 genomes had ﬁve changes or fewer compared to the
reference isolate Ang1379c. Remarkably, four of the se-
quences, obtained from clinical samples collected over a month
and a half, showed no nucleotide differences for the entire
19,114-nucleotide genome. This conﬁrmed the high ﬁdelity of
the RT-PCR-based sequence analysis performed and demon-
strated that human-to-human passage of marburgvirus could
occur in the absence of virus evolution. In addition, our refer-
ence sequence, Ang1379c, was also 100% identical to the
sequence obtained from the corresponding virus isolate,
Ang1379v, indicating the lack of selection occurring during
culture of the virus from the clinical specimen. The most ge-

netically diverse genome came from a specimen collected in
the Songo municipality (specimen 0754), which had a total of
11 nucleotide changes (out of 19,114 bases) relative to the
reference isolate (0.07% variation). Each of the unique
changes were independently conﬁrmed by generation of small
(1-kb) RT-PCR fragments followed by sequence analysis. In
contrast, the analysis of three isolates from within the earlier
Durba, DRC, outbreak showed at least 10 times greater se-
quence diversity, ranging from 0.8 to 21% nucleotide differ-
ence. The 05DRC and 07DRC isolates differed by 0.8% (150
nucleotide differences) and differed by over 21% when each was
compared to the 09DRC isolate. The 09DRC isolate is notewor-
thy because it represents the second member of the most distinct
lineage within the marburgviruses, ﬁrst deﬁned by the Rav isolate
(20). The minimal genetic diversity observed in the Angola out-
break (maximum of 0.07% variation) relative to that seen in the
Durba (0.8 to 21% variation) is consistent with the Angola mar-
burgvirus outbreak being the result of a rare introduction of virus
into the human population from the unknown reservoir followed
by direct human-to-human transmission.
Comparative analysis of marburgvirus genetic elements.
The determination of the Ang, Rav, 05DRC, 07DRC, and
09DRC full-length sequences almost tripled the number of
marburgvirus genomes available for analysis. Therefore, using

this more extensive database of full-length sequences, a com-
prehensive effort was undertaken to reexamine many genetic
features throughout the genome and determine the degree to
which these elements are maintained across all eight marburg-
virus strains. An initial macroscopic perspective of genome
similarity is shown in Fig. 4, in which full-length genomes were
analyzed for similarity using a sliding window of 50 nucleo-
tides. The similarity plot reveals a striking pattern of sequence
conservation among the open reading frames ﬂanked by re-
gions of much greater variation in the noncoding sequences.
However, the more variable noncoding regions are punctuated
with spikes of high identity corresponding to the regions con-
taining transcription start and stop sequences (arrows). Align-
ments of the individual cis-acting regulatory features demon-
strate that 12 of 14 transcription start and stop sequences are
100% identical (Fig. 5). Of the two start/stop sequences that
show variation, the differences are merely single-nucleotide
transitions and are within the Ravn/09DRC lineages. In all

genomic elements examined, the Angola sequence shows
100% identity with the consensus sequence. Well conserved
genomic features include the lengths of the 5 and 3 untrans-
lated regions of all seven predicted mRNAs, some of which
differ slightly from previous reports (8, 15), as well as the
length and composition of the six intergenic (IR) sequences. A
few notable variations within the IRs are a requirement for a
purine residue in the ﬁrst position of the trinucleotide IR
between VP24 and L and conserved differences within the
Ravn/09DRC lineage at three of seven positions in the IR
between NP and VP35.
An examination of the nucleotide and amino acid distances
for each of the seven marburgvirus gene products is shown in
Fig. 6A and B, respectively. At the nucleotide level the most
conserved genes are, in order, VP40, NP, VP24, and VP35,
showing 0.2 to 15.2% variation, closely followed by VP30,
showing 0.3 to 17.4% variation. The gene with the greatest
nucleotide differences is GP (0.7 to 22.5%), consistent with
previous alignments using fewer marburgvirus strains (8, 20,
45). Surprisingly, the nucleotide difference in the polymer-
ase (0.5 to 21.4%) is almost as much as that seen in the GP

region despite having some stretches of very high conserva-
tion (Fig. 7G).
At the amino acid level, the percent differences among the
marburgvirus strains for each of the seven gene products are
quite different from those seen within the same genes at the
nucleotide level. The degrees of variation within all the open
reading frames, except GP, are decreased by 2- to 10-fold. The
most striking example is the matrix protein VP40, in which the
decrease is about 10-fold, demonstrating a distinct intolerance
for amino acid changes (1.65% maximum variation). This in-
tolerance is suggestive of tight physical constraints for VP40 in
the virus assembly process. At the other end of the spectrum,
GP showed no decrease at all in the level of amino acid vari-
ation (23%) relative to that seen at the nucleotide level,
suggesting a selective pressure for nonsynonymous changes,
most likely exerted by the immune system of the natural res-
ervoir host(s).
We next examined known protein domains and motifs in
each of the seven open reading frames by comparative align-
ment of the amino acid sequences (Fig. 7A to G). The analysis
of GP (Fig. 7D) shows that the area of greatest diversity is a
continuous 300-amino-acid (aa) stretch from residue 201 to

501, a region previously divided into two smaller variable do-
mains (45). Despite this diversity, a number of previously de-
scribed features remain well conserved, many of which reside
within this central variable domain. These features include 13
of 14 proposed N-glycosylation sites (N-x-T/S) and 12 of 12
cysteines (45). Elsewhere in GP, the transmembrane domain
(aa 649 to 670) and proposed fusion domain (aa 526 to 540)
show 100% identity among all eight strains of marburgvirus, as
does the furin cleavage site R-X-K/R-R (aa 432 to 435) (54).
Volchkov et al. (52) proposed the presence of an immunosup-
pressive domain (ISD) in GP2 of ebolavirus based on analogy
to retroviruses. This 26-amino-acid motif is also present in
marburgvirus (55) and shows a single Thr-to-Ala substitution
at position 12 of the Angola sequence. Lending importance to
the function of the ISD motif, recent studies have shown that
17-residue monomers of ﬁlovirus ISDs are capable of suppress-
ing T-cell activation and Th1-related cytokine production in
activated human and nonhuman primate peripheral blood

mononuclear cells (59). All other positions of the ISD show
complete conservation. Another posttranslational modiﬁcation
ascribed to GP is the potential for phosphorylation at serine
residues in two independent motifs between amino acids 260
and 273 (46). The GP alignments demonstrate that only one
phosphorylation site, encompassing amino acids 268 to 273, is
conserved among all eight marburgviruses. The other site, a
diserine motif at amino acids 260 to 261, is not present in ﬁve
of eight strains, thus discounting this motif as a general feature
of all marburgviruses.
Within the alignment of marburgvirus L amino acid se-
quences (Fig. 7G), the regions showing the greatest variation
are clustered into ﬁve domains, i.e., amino acids 114 to 135,
262 to 348, 1143 to 1206, 1623 to 1645, and 1677 to 1866. The
last domain, encompassing residues 1677 to 1866, may contain
a hinge region within the polymerase based on analogy to
morbilliviruses, which have been shown to tolerate the inser-
tion of the green ﬂuorescent protein within the proposed hinge
(13, 31).The areas of greatest conservation within the marburg-
virus L sequences are in three large blocks, amino acids 349 to
1142, 1207 to 1622, and 1867 to 2322. The ﬁrst of these three
areas, amino acids 349 to 1142, contain the box A, B, and C
sequences common to paramyxo- and rhabdovirus L proteins
(3, 36). Boxes A and B share 100% identity among the aligned

marburgvirus sequences, while box C has a single K-to-R sub-
stitution in the Rav and 09DRC lineages. Two other motifs
purported to be present in all polymerases of negative-sense
RNA viruses are the diresidue D-D and QGDNQ motifs (3, 21).
These were previously identiﬁed in the Mus marburgvirus L se-
quence (36) and are thought to be essential components of the
polymerase catalytic core. In this alignment, these potential cat-
alytic core motifs are all 100% conserved, with the exception of
one diresidue D-D motif at amino acids 91 to 93, which shows
degeneracy at two positions in the Ravn and 09DRC lineages. In
addition, there is a putative ATP and/or purine ribonucleoside
triphosphate binding domain found in all known L proteins of
single-strand negative-sense viruses (amino acids 1931 to 1956)
(36), referred to as motif C in an alignment of ﬁlovirus L se-
quences (53), that shows 100% identity at the core consensus
glycine residues and identity at 23 of 26 positions overall within
the motif. Three other potential ATP binding motifs at residues,
1325 to 1360, 1390 to 1420, and 1560 to 1593 (36), show complete
identity among all taxa analyzed. Finally, 46 of 52 consensus
cysteine residues are completely conserved, including the dicys-

teine motif at positions 1376 to 1377, as previously noted (36),
which are found in most L proteins at similar locations and are
believed to anchor protein secondary structure to maintain the
necessary conformation of the putative active sites.
Outside of the polymerase and glycoprotein, a few notable
genomic elements reside in the NP, VP35, and VP30 genes. An
alignment of NP amino acid sequences (Fig. 7A) shows that
nearly all the variability is in the C-terminal half of the protein,
similar to that seen in a recent comparison of Zaire and Sudan
ebolavirus full-length genome sequences (44). Within this
same half of the protein are seven unique phosphorylation
domains (28), each containing one or more serine/threonine
kinase substrate motifs. Yet, despite the overall variation, the
majority of individual kinase recognition motifs are conserved
to the point that, regardless of the marburgvirus strain exam-
ined, at least one motif is present within each of the seven
domains. The maintenance of these motifs highlights the po-
tential role for phosphorylation in this region of NP, an area
postulated to effect protein-protein interactions.
VP35 protein of marburgvirus plays an essential role in tran-

scription and replication of viral RNA. A predicted coiled-coil
domain with residues 70 to 120 may effect VP35 oligomeriza-
tion, an interaction which in turn may be necessary for VP35 to
bridge NP with L to form the active polymerase complex (35).
At the heart of the presumed coiled-coil domain are heptad
repeats containing hydrophobic residues at the ﬁrst and fourth
positions. This domain shows variability at nine positions (Fig.
7B). Yet despite this variation, the spacing of the hydropho-
bicity is strictly maintained among all the aligned sequences.
The Angola sequence shows no variation whatsoever from the
consensus sequence throughout the 50-amino-acid domain. In
addition to its role in RNA replication, VP35 of ebolavirus has
recently been shown to contain an 11-amino-acid motif (Zaire
ebolavirus residues 304 to 314) that is thought to be essential
for type I interferon (IFN) antagonism (19). This motif, which
is possibly involved in RNA binding, is also present in mar-
burgvirus (residues 293 to 303) and has identity at 9 of 11
positions with that of ebolavirus, including the three basic
amino acids experimentally demonstrated to be important.
Further highlighting the potential importance of this VP35

domain, the alignment (Fig. 7B) reveals that this domain is a
general feature of all known marburgviruses.
VP30 of Zaire ebolavirus has been shown to contain an
unconventional Cys3-His zinc binding domain whose integrity
has been shown to be required for VP30 function in virus
transcription (33). The alignment in Fig. 7E shows the high
conservation of all four zinc-coordinating residues among all
eight marburgvirus taxa. Adjacent to the zinc binding domain
is a well-conserved tetraleucine motif which could facilitate
VP30 oligomerization, similar to that observed with ebolavirus
VP30 (18).
Finally, VP24, whose alignment is shown in Fig. 7F, is highly
conserved throughout the protein. Recent studies of marburg-
virus VP24 have implicated it to be involved in nucleocapsid
assembly and interactions between nucleocapsids and budding
sites at the plasma membrane (2). In addition, ebolavirus VP24
has been shown to bind Karyopherin 	1 and to block STAT1
nuclear accumulation, thus implicating VP24 as a virulence
determinant that allows ebolavirus to evade antiviral effects of
IFNs (41). Consistent with the idea that VP24 may be a viru-
lence determinant, both mouse- and guinea pig-adapted ebo-
laviruses, each of which is capable of 100% lethality in its
respective animal model, have amino changes that map to
VP24 (7, 51).
DISCUSSION
In this report we describe the laboratory conﬁrmation of the
ﬁrst known marburgvirus outbreak in West Africa, along with
an extensive comparative genomic analysis of marburgviruses.
Virus associated with previous Marburg HF outbreaks had all
originated in East Africa, and up to 21% virus genetic diversity
had been found based on analysis of partial genome sequences.
Consequently, the discovery of Marburg HF in Angola was a
surprise, as was the ﬁnding that the Angolan marburgvirus was
not more distinct, differing from the main group of East Afri-
can marburgviruses by only 7%. Presumably the absence of a
greater genetic difference reﬂects virus natural host reservoir
similarities between the East and West African locations.
However, due to the resource-poor nature of the affected area,
an index case was never identiﬁed, and thus the importation of
the virus from East Africa, while unlikely, cannot be ruled out.
By the same token, the large virus genetic difference seen
between the Ravn/09DRC lineage and the other marburgvi-
ruses may represent reservoir host differences, such that vi-
ruses within this lineage may be associated with a different host
species or subspecies than the other marburgviruses. Interest-
ingly, earlier ecological niche modeling approaches had pre-
dicted that parts of northern and eastern Angola were within
the range for potential ﬁlovirus reservoirs (39, 40).
The natural reservoir for marburgvirus remains unknown, but
marburgvirus emergence in Angola will likely extend the scope of
the reservoir search beyond East Africa. As recently reported (5),
the marburgvirus outbreak in Durba, DRC, was closely associated
with illegal mining activity. Epidemiological data linked over 70%
of the cases with mines or caves, suggesting that the natural
reservoir could well be associated with such environments. With
the Angola outbreak, difﬁculties in surveillance and contact trac-
ing, combined with the delay in the identiﬁcation of the outbreak,
led to poor epidemiological linkage of marburgvirus cases and
ultimately to a lack of success in identifying a point source or
mounting any ecological study. Filovirus outbreaks in general are
relatively rare events. A recent report has suggested that bat
species with rather wide geographic distributions may be a poten-
tial reservoir for ebolavirus (24). If the natural reservoir of mar-
burgvirus is similar to that of ebolavirus, the emergence of mar-
burgvirus in western Africa should not be surprising, as the sites
of multiple large ebolavirus outbreaks are less than 500 miles
away, including areas which have experienced almost yearly ac-
tivity over the last decade (25, 26).
The initial diagnosis was based on 9 of 12 clinical specimens

testing positive by virus isolation, antigen, and/or PCR-based
methods, including a newly designed Q-RT-PCR assay de-
signed to detect the VP40 genome region of all known strains
of marburgvirus. This Q-RT-PCR assay outperformed all
other assays designed to detect acute marburgvirus infection,
including the “gold standard” virus isolation assay. The assay
was also sufﬁciently robust to allow deployment into a ﬁeld
setting in Angola. The extensive virus genomic analysis pre-
sented here also conﬁrms that the VP40 gene target was an
excellent choice for a broadly reactive marburgvirus detection
assay, as it is the most conserved virus gene. These features
suggest this should be a highly useful assay for detection of
potential naturally occurring or deliberate Marburg HF out-
breaks in the future.
Following the initial diagnosis, we determined the full-
length genome sequence directly from clinical material from 11
patients representing the temporal and geographic distribution
of the outbreak. Our purpose was to fully characterize the level
of sequence variation generated during the course of a large
marburgvirus outbreak with a high case fatality rate and to use
this information to determine whether multiple marburgvirus
introductions into the human population had occurred. To
generate a context with which to compare the Angola mar-
burgvirus sequence data, we determined the complete genome
sequence of the Ravn marburgvirus, ﬁrst isolated in 1987 in
Kenya, as well as three additional, uncharacterized marburg-
viruses from Durba, DRC, the location of the largest outbreak
on record prior to the one in Angola. Our data increased the
number of the complete genome reference sequences from
three to eight. Therefore, we used this expanded database to
review the known genetic elements throughout the genome in
an effort to assess their importance based upon the degree to
which the features are maintained across the eight marburgvi-
rus strains. One of the most striking features is the high degree
to which nearly all the genetic elements previously identiﬁed
were maintained. To some extent this was expected, but we
predicted that perhaps the Ravn and 09DRC lineages, differing
by greater than 21% from all other marburgviruses at the
nucleotide level, would show more versatility as to how the
viral proteins could potentially carry out their functions. Di-
versity within marburgviruses is still, even with this more com-
plete data set, considerably less than that seen with the ebola-
viruses, to the point that the Ravn/09DRC lineage would not
be considered a different species. In fact, the three most con-
served genes, VP40, VP24, and L, among the major species of
ebolavirus (Zaire, Sudan, and Reston) show 20 to 25% protein
diversity (44). In contrast, those same genes within the mar-
burgvirus lineages shown here have, respectively, 1.6, 4.3, and
12.3% maximum diversity.
Given the general error-prone nature of RNA virus poly-
merases, the fact that there were comparatively few changes
observed among the 11 Angolan marburgvirus isolates was
somewhat surprising. In fact, four of the complete genome
sequences (19,114 nucleotides in length) from specimens col-
lected over a month and a half and representing at least two to
three human to human transmission cycles were 100% identi-
cal. In the absence of precise knowledge of transmission events
from the natural reservoir, possibly bats (24, 47), this analysis
attempts to answer the question of what level of sequence
divergence constitutes a distinct lineage versus the degree of
sequence variation to be expected in a large outbreak of single
origination. To answer this question, we felt it important to
compare the diversity seen in the Angola outbreak with that in
the Durba, DRC, outbreak. Among the sequences from the
Angola outbreak, the representative from the Songo munici-
pality (specimen 0754) had 11 nucleotide differences from the
reference isolate (0.07% variation). However, this maximum
level of variation is 1/10 of the minimum diversity seen be-
tween the two closest lineages within the Durba outbreak,
05DRC and 07DRC, respectively (0.8% variation). Based on
this comparison, we do not consider the Songo lineage to be
indicative of a second introduction, although such a possibility
cannot be ruled out. For the Angola marburgvirus outbreak, it
would be interesting to measure the rate of accumulation of
nucleotide changes over time, but unfortunately, the epidemi-
ological links between the 11 patients could not be established
and there is no Angola marburgvirus isolate from the pre-
sumed beginning of the outbreak in October 2004.
Genome plasticity and rapid evolution in response to posi-
tive selection are general features of RNA viruses which pos-
sess error-prone polymerases and lack proofreading mecha-
nisms (12). Such features have been well documented in recent
outbreaks of emergent RNA viruses, such as severe acute res-
piratory syndrome coronavirus and human immunodeﬁciency
virus (HIV), in which genetic differences have been shown to
accumulate during human-to-human transmission events and,
in some instances, within the same tissues of a single host (27,
43). Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus has re-
cently been calculated to accumulate approximately two mu-
tations per genome per human transmission event (50). Why,
then, was so little variation found within this marburgvirus
outbreak? The answer likely involves at least two related com-
ponents, namely, (i) the time of progression within the host
from initial infection to disease outcome and (ii) the host
immune response to marburgvirus infection. With HIV, highly
diverse quasispecies have been shown to develop from homo-
geneous populations in response to the development of host
neutralizing antibodies and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses
(6). Yet, in the later stages of HIV infection towards the
development of AIDS, the immune system is no longer able to
exert strong selective pressure on the replicating quasispecies
and, as a result, HIV evolution dramatically slows (11). For
marburgvirus, like Zaire ebolavirus, disease progression is so
rapid that most individuals die before an effective immune
response can be mounted (1, 22, 48). For ebolavirus the me-
dian time to death after onset of symptoms is only 8 to 9 days
(22, 48). In addition to the rapid course of infection, ebolavirus
actively suppresses the immune system by (i) directly antago-
nizing the host interferon system through an uncharacterized
mechanism involving the virus VP35 protein (4) and (ii) pref-
erentially infecting dendritic cells and macrophages as sites of
primary infection, thus diminishing host cell populations that
are critical for the establishment of innate and adaptive im-
mune responses (16, 17). These features together allow for
explosive virus growth within the host in a manner virtually
unchecked by the immune system. The lack of IgM and IgG
responses shown in Table 1 is consistent with this view. The
lack of genetic diversity within the Angola marburgvirus out-
break is therefore not surprising and is in fact consistent with
the absence of genetic differences seen among genome fragments

of viruses analyzed in previous Zaire and Sudan ebolavirus out-
breaks (42, 48).
A trial sampling procedure that emerged during the out-
break was the use of oral swabs for sampling suspected Mar-
burg VHF corpses. RNA extracted from oral swabs sometimes
gave low CT values in the Q-RT-PCR assay (Table 2 and data
not shown), indicating the potential for high viral loads in these
secretions. Unfortunately, deﬁnitive interpretations of CT val-
ues from oral swabs are difﬁcult, since the swabbing technique
and the volumes recovered are inherently variable. In general,
very high viral loads are seen in sera of individuals infected
with ﬁloviruses. For instance, during human infections with
Sudan ebolavirus, viral loads in patient serum can vary from
105 RNA copies/ml at the time of fever onset to greater than
1010 RNA copies/ml at the time of death (48). However, the
timing and extent to which this range of viral load is reﬂected
in human oral/nasal secretions are currently unknown. Of par-
ticular concern is the use of this sampling technique as a means
of establishing a particular etiology of a VHF outbreak when
multiple agents must be considered and tested, many of which
may not ever produce viral loads that can be detected by oral
swabs. Blood-based sampling as a reliable source of virus for
serology-, antigen-, and PCR-based detection assays is well
documented and should remain the method of choice for sam-
pling suspected VHF patients.
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
The management of the outbreak was greatly assisted by the Min-
istry of Health, Republic of Angola; the World Health Organization;
and the International Response Team. We thank the Instituto Nacio-
nal de Sau
´de Publica and Amilcar Tanuri of the CDC Global Aids
Program for their excellent technical and logistical assistance with the
CDC ﬁeld lab and their devotion to the resolution of this public health
crisis. The efforts of Daniel Kertesz of the World Health Organization
were critical for sending the initial sets of diagnostic specimens to
CDC, Atlanta, Ga. We also thank the U.S. Embassy to Angola, the
U.S. Ofﬁce of Foreign Disaster Assistance for their essential ﬁnancial
and logistical support, and the Chevron Corporation for the loan of a
crucial electrical generator. The CDC ﬁeld lab was well supported by
the technical assistance of Jennifer B. Oliver, Deborah L. Cannon,
Kimberly A. Slaughter, and Thomas L. Stevens, while the ﬁeld lab of
the Public Health Agency of Canada was similarly supported by Lisa
Fernando, Allen Grolla, Steven M. Jones, Jim E. Strong, and Heinz
Feldmann. We also acknowledge Mike Frace and Brian Halloway for
making available multiple components of the CDC Biotechnology
Core Facility, which immensely facilitated this study.
