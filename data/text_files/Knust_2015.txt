Abstract
In October 2012, a cluster of illnesses and deaths was reported in Uganda and was confirmed to be 
an outbreak of Marburg virus disease (MVD). Patients meeting the case criteria were interviewed 
using a standard investigation form, and blood specimens were tested for evidence of acute or 
recent Marburg virus infection by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and 
antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The total count of confirmed and probable MVD 
cases was 26, of which 15 (58%) were fatal. Four of 15 laboratory-confirmed cases (27%) were 
fatal. Case patients were located in 4 different districts in Uganda, although all chains of 
transmission originated in Ibanda District, and the earliest case detected had an onset in July 2012. 
No zoonotic exposures were identified. Symptoms significantly associated with being a MVD case 
included hiccups, anorexia, fatigue, vomiting, sore throat, and difficulty swallowing. Contact with 
a case patient and attending a funeral were also significantly associated with being a case. Average 
RT-PCR cycle threshold values for fatal cases during the acute phase of illness were significantly 
lower than those for nonfatal cases. Following the institution of contact tracing, active case 
surveillance, care of patients with isolation precautions, community mobilization, and rapid 
diagnostic testing, the outbreak was successfully contained 14 days after its initial detection.

Viruses within the family Filoviridae, genera Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus, can cause viral 
hemorrhagic fever in humans with a high case-fatality rate (CFR; 23%–90%) [1, 2]. The 
Marburgvirus genus contains 2 closely related viruses, which, together, will be simply 
referred to here as Marburg virus. Outbreaks of Ebola virus disease (EVD) and Marburg 
virus disease (MVD) begin when an initial zoonotic transmission from an infected animal to 
a human occurs, and the transmission is then amplified through close human-to-human 
contact. Direct and unprotected contact with blood and other body fluids from viremic 
patients or corpses is the chief means of transmission among humans, and transmission via 
droplets and fomites is also possible [3, 4].
Repeated detection of Marburg virus–specific RNA and isolation of virus from bats captured 
in the wild has demonstrated that the reservoir of currently known Marburg viruses is the 
Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) [5]. Previous cases and several outbreaks of MVD 
have been linked to exposure in caves and/or mines inhabited by Egyptian fruit bats [6–9]. 
Previous outbreaks of MVD in Uganda occurred in 2007 and 2008, with 4 cases among 
miners entering the Kitaka mine in Ibanda District [7] and 2 isolated cases among tourists 
entering Python Cave in Queen Elizabeth National Park [8, 9]. Primates are also susceptible 
to viruses in the Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus genera, which cause clinical signs of EVD 
and MVD, respectively, and transmission to humans has occurred following exposure to sick 
or dead primates [10–13].
Previous EVD and MVD outbreaks with high case counts (315 cases of EVD were reported 
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo during 1995, and 425 cases of EVD were reported 
in Uganda during 2000) [4, 14] and high CFRs (88% among individuals with MVD in 
Angola during 2005) [15] have led the international community to develop well-described 
procedures for rapidly investigating and extinguishing confirmed outbreaks by halting the 
chain of human-to-human transmission [16–19]. Outbreak measures coordinated by national 
and subnational multisectoral, multidisciplinary outbreak coordination committees seek to 
halt the chain of virus transmission by identifying all current cases, instituting barrier 
nursing practices in hospital facilities designed to contain patients in isolation, and closely 
following contacts of cases, with prompt isolation and testing of patients if clinical signs 
develop. Engagement of the community through education and social mobilization are 
essential for the success of responses. Community members must be aware of disease 
transmission risks and comfortable with sending patients to treatment centers and providing 
information to the investigation teams to ensure complete ascertainment of cases and 
identification of all contacts [4, 17].
The presence of real-time diagnostic capacity in the field is vital to providing rapid 
information regarding patient infection status, prognosis, and risk of virus transmission. The 
symptoms of EVD and MVD are frequently nonspecific, with fever, fatigue, and 
gastrointestinal signs predominating, thus making mandatory laboratory confirmation of 
infection necessary for discerning these diseases from other, more common causes of febrile 
illness. Detection of virus RNA (via reverse transcription– polymerase chain reaction [RT-
PCR]) or antigen (via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) in serum or blood 
indicates that the patient is currently viremic and can be infectious to others [20], which is

important for determining whether a patient should be placed in or remain under isolation 
conditions. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) also provides a means to determine the relative 
virus load, which can inform the survival prognosis [21].Immunoglobulin M(IgM) antibody 
(detected via ELISA) is a marker of recent infection, owing to the disappearance of IgM 2–3 
months after infection onset, whereas immunoglobulin G (IgG) can persist for ≥
10 years 
[22].
On 16 October 2012, a cluster of illnesses and deaths was reported in Kabale District, 
western Uganda. Blood specimens were collected from 3 affected individuals, and on 18 
October, testing at the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI)/Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC) hemorrhagic fever laboratory confirmed Marburg virus infection in 
these patients. The outbreak response was led by the Uganda Ministry of Health, with 
assistance from the World Health Organization, the CDC, Médecins sans Frontières, the 
Uganda Peoples Defense Forces, the Uganda Red Cross, and the African Field 
Epidemiology Network. In this article, we describe findings of the outbreak investigation 
and diagnostic testing and review the clinical symptoms of cases.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The case definitions for MVD in this outbreak were as follows (Figure 1). A suspected case 
patient had either (1) fever (axillary temperature, ≥
37.5°C) and ≥
3 symptoms indicative of 
MVD, (2) any unexplained bleeding, or (3) any unexplained or sudden death. A probable 
case patient had illness meeting the suspected case definition and a history of contact with a 
patient who had probable or confirmed MVD. A confirmed case patient was any suspected 
or probable case patient with laboratory-confirmed evidence of acute or previous Marburg 
virus infection, as detected by RT-PCR, antigen-capture ELISA, or IgM/IgG ELISA. 
Suspected and probable case patients were reclassified as “not a case” if diagnostic test 
results for a specimen collected during the appropriate period were negative.
A standard case investigation form was used to collect epidemiologic and clinical 
information about each potential case patient. In the initial phases of the investigation, 
efforts were made to identify and test all persons who were currently ill and fit the suspected 
case patient definition in designated hospital facilities with isolation precautions. Persons 
who had direct or indirect contact with confirmed or probable case patients while they were 
symptomatic were systematically identified and visited daily for 21 days after their last 
contact. If they developed symptoms during the surveillance period, the contacts were 
hospitalized under isolation precautions and tested for acute Marburg virus infection. Once 
the current case patients and their contacts had been identified, a retrospective investigation 
sought to identify cases that had occurred prior to the outbreak’s detection, and surviving 
persons were tested for previous Marburg virus infection, through IgM and IgG serological 
analysis. Symptoms were recorded at the time of admission to the isolation ward for current 
cases or, for retrospective cases, were summarized throughout the illness.
Blood and serum specimens from acutely ill patients were tested in the field by RT-PCR as 
follows. Total RNA was extracted with the BeadRetriever system (Invitrogen), using the 
MagMax Viral RNA isolation kit (Applied Biosystem). Marburg virus–specific qRT-PCR

assays targeting the VP40 gene and polymerase gene were performed on each specimen. 
Blood and serum specimens from patients with acute illness and patients who had recovered 
were also tested for anti–Marburg virus IgM and IgG by ELISA, using previously described 
methods [23].
All confirmed case patients who were acutely ill (ie, those with positive qRT-PCR results) 
were hospitalized in treatment centers, using barrier nursing techniques. Confirmed case 
patients remained under isolation until Marburg virus RNA was not detected in their blood, 
as measured by qRT-PCR. Suspected case patients who had clinically improved were 
allowed to be discharged from the treatment center if they had negative blood qRT-PCR 
results on day 3 or later after the onset of symptoms, and they were classified as “not a 
case.” Case patients who died were buried by a trained team, using appropriate infection 
control measures.
Case investigation forms were tabulated in a computerized spreadsheet (Excel), and 
summary statistics were calculated using statistical analysis software (Epi Info 7; SAS). A 
bivariate χ2 comparison of symptoms was performed by classifying confirmed and probable 
case patients as MVD case patients and by classifying patients with negative test results and 
complete information as controls. P values were corrected for 32 simultaneous comparisons, 
using the technique of Benjamini and Hochberg [24], to balance power and type 1 error. 
Statistical significance was accepted at a P value of ≤
.01. Similarly, recorded symptoms of 
confirmed and probable cases were compared by the Fisher exact test and evaluated for 
association with fatal outcome. Maps of affected regions were created using geospatial 
information system software (ESRI ArcMap 10.0).
RESULTS
In total, 15 laboratory-confirmed cases of MVD were identified, with 9 detected during 
acute illness (RT-PCR results were positive) and 6 detected during convalescence (RT-PCR 
results were negative, and IgM/IgG ELISA results were positive). Four confirmed cases 
were fatal. Eleven probable cases were identified, all of which were fatal cases. The total 
count of confirmed and probable MVD cases was 26, of which 15 (58%) were fatal. Ages 
ranged from newborn to 64 years; 16 case patients (62%) were female.
Confirmed case patients resided in 3 districts of Uganda (Kabale, Ibanda, and Kamwenge; 
Figure 2) and were hospitalized in treatment centers in 3 districts (Kabale, Ibanda, and 
Mbarara) and Kampala. To facilitate rapid specimen testing, a field laboratory was set up in 
Kabale to perform same-day qRT-PCR testing. Additional laboratory support was provided 
by the viral hemorrhagic fever laboratory in UVRI (Entebbe), which performed ELISAs to 
determine Marburg virus–specific IgM and IgG titers and qRT-PCR testing on specimens 
from outside Kabale and Ibanda districts. During the outbreak investigation, 198 specimens 
from 173 individuals were tested. In addition to the 3 affected districts, diagnostic specimens 
from suspected case patients were submitted from 17 districts across Uganda.
Serial blood specimens were collected from 3 MVD case patients who survived infection 
(Figure 3). Among the specimens available for testing, qRT-PCR threshold cycle (CT) values

were lowest (signifying the highest quantity of virus load) at the earliest point of sampling 
(6–7 days after symptom onset) and declined to undetectable levels 16–22 days after 
symptom onset. IgM antibody was first detected 7–16 days after onset of symptoms, while 
IgG was first detected 13–23 days after onset. CT values from blood specimens collected <8 
days after symptom onset from 4 surviving case patients were compared with values for 5 
case patients who died (Figure 4). Average CT values from case patients who died were 
significantly lower than those for surviving case patients (P = .02 by the t test, assuming 
equal variances).
The outbreak had 2 separate chains of transmission at the time of the investigation, in 
October 2012 (Figure 5), which could not be directly linked to each other epidemiologically. 
However, both chains occurred in Ibanda District contemporaneously, and molecular 
analysis of isolates from each chain yielded nearly identical virus sequences [25], indicating 
that the 2 chains were likely connected and originated from the same unidentified spillover 
event. The earliest confirmed case patient (detected retrospectively via IgG ELISA) had an 
estimated onset of illness in mid-July 2012, nearly 3 months before the outbreak was 
detected, in mid-October 2012. Subsequent infections in family members occurred in Ibanda 
and Kamwenge districts during August–October 2012, affecting 6 confirmed and 6 probable 
case patients. The last case patient in this first detected chain of transmission was admitted 
to a treatment center on 31 October 2012. The first case patient in the second chain of 
transmission was a probable case patient who worked in Ibanda District and traveled to 
Kabale District to be cared for by family when he became ill in mid-September 2012; the 
infection spread to family members, close associates (a religious leader and her child), and 1 
healthcare worker located in Kabale District, affecting 9 confirmed and 5 probable case 
patients. The last case patient in this second chain of transmission was admitted to the 
Kabale treatment center on 29 October 2012. No case patients in either transmission chain 
reported activities that placed them in contact with bats or other potential wildlife sources.
Symptoms recorded for all 26 confirmed and probable case patients and 125 controls are 
reported in Table 1. Reported symptoms for confirmed and probable case patients were also 
analyzed separately, and no significant differences were found in the proportions of 
symptoms reported between these 2 groups. Nearly all confirmed and probable cases (96%) 
had fever; anorexia, fatigue, headache, and vomiting were present in >75%. Half of 
confirmed and probable case patients (13 [50%]) had hemorrhagic symptoms, which 
included vaginal bleeding (4 female case patients [29%]), epistaxis (5 case patients [21%]), 
bleeding gums (4 case patients [17%]), hematemesis (4 case patients [17%]), petechiae (2 
case patients [11%]), hemoptysis (2 case patients [8%]), and hemorrhage indicative of 
disseminated intravascular coagulation (1 case patient [6%]). Conjunctival hemorrhage or 
“red eyes” were noted in 3 case patients (13%). Hiccups and anorexia had the strongest 
associations with being a confirmed or probable case patient (OR, 22.9 and 19.3, 
respectively; P < .0001 for both), and fatigue, vomiting, sore throat, and difficulty 
swallowing were also significantly associated with being a confirmed or probable case 
patient. Attending a funeral prior to illness onset (OR, 5.3; P = .0006) and having direct 
contact with another confirmed, probable, or suspected case patient (OR, 33.4; P < .0001) 
were risk factors significantly associated with being a confirmed or probable case patient 
(Table 2). Fatal outcome was compared between confirmed case patients (n = 9) and

controls, and this was significantly associated with being a case patient (OR, 6.9; P = .003). 
No symptoms or risk factors were significantly associated with a fatal outcome among 
confirmed and probable case patients (data not shown).
Nine confirmed case patients were admitted to treatment centers, of whom 3 (33%) died, 
compared with deaths among 12 of 15 confirmed and probable case patients (71%) who 
were not cared for in an isolation facility (P = .1). Among confirmed case patients who died, 
death occurred a mean of 9 days after onset of symptoms, while death among probable case 
patients occurred a mean of 6.5 days after onset. For confirmed and probable case patients, 
hospitalization occurred a mean of 4 days after symptom onset. The 6 surviving confirmed 
case patients were discharged from isolation a mean of 22 days (range, 16–30 days) after 
onset of symptoms and spent a mean of 14.3 days (range, 4–22 days) in isolation. Many of 
the controls suspected of having MVD were hospitalized while laboratory testing was 
performed, and of 11 with information on isolation duration available, discharge from 
isolation occurred a mean of 4 days after admission (range, 0–12 days). For confirmed case 
patients, the distribution of days after symptom onset that a patient was reported or detected 
was bimodal: acutely detected cases were identified 0–6 days after onset, while convalescent 
cases detected during the retrospective case investigation were identified 29–105 days after 
onset.
Once the outbreak was detected, 327 persons were listed as having had contact with 
confirmed or probable case patients and were followed for 21 days after their last date of 
contact. Only 1 direct contact that was under follow-up and the child of this case patient 
developed MVD. All other case patients were discovered prior to the commencement of 
contact tracing.
DISCUSSION
The outbreak described in this article represents the first epidemic of MVD with multiple 
generations of human-to-human transmission to occur in Uganda, affecting 26 patients in 3 
districts. This most likely resulted from low-level and undetected community transmission 
from the outbreak’s beginning (late July or earlier) to early October 2012. Similar to the 
MVD outbreak in Uige, Angola [26], full-length genome sequences of virus from 4 case 
patients (2 from each transmission chain) in the 2012 Uganda MVD outbreak were nearly 
identical (>99%), strongly suggesting a single spillover event from wildlife, with subsequent 
human-to-human transmission [25]. This is in contrast with the occurrence of MVD in 
Watsa, Democratic Republic of the Congo, where 9 different virus lineages were found in 
case patients, demonstrating a rather different picture of multiple spillover events beginning 
with gold miners who were exposed to bats in the Goroumbwa mine [6].
The zoonotic spillover event initiating the 2012 Uganda MVD outbreak was not identified, 
although the earliest confirmed case originated in Ibanda District, the same district housing 
the Kitaka mine, where the 2007 MVD epidemic occurred and where a large R. aegyptiacus 
population infected with Marburg virus was found [7]. The mine was closed following the 
2007 outbreak but was reopened during 2009, and full mining activity had resumed in 2010. 
No links were found between any case in the 2012 outbreak and mining activity or cave

exposures, but the close proximity of the mine and its recent reopening is a striking 
coincidence.
Among 3 confirmed case patients who survived, we found that the highest viremia level, 
based on the CT value determined by qRT-PCR, occurred approximately 5–7 days after onset 
of symptoms and persisted to approximately 16–22 days after onset in survivors. IgM titers 
were detectable 7–16 days after symptom onset, while IgG became detectable 13–16 days 
after onset. While the number of case patients with serial blood specimens was quite limited 
and specimens were collected at variable times, the timing of viral RNA detection in blood 
and anti–Marburg IgM and IgG detection roughly corresponded to findings in previous case 
reports of Ebola virus and Sudan virus infection [21, 22].Viral load in acute blood specimens 
(ie, specimens obtained <8 days after symptom onset), as measured by the qRT-PCR CT 
value, was also significantly associated with outcome, with case patients who died having 
significantly lower CT values than surviving case patients, in agreement with findings for 
patients infected with Sudan virus [21]. In this analysis, there were no associations between 
the presence of particular clinical symptoms and fatal outcome, which may be related to the 
small number of cases available for comparison. In the Watsa outbreak, hiccups, 
conjunctival injection, and hemorrhagic symptoms were all associated with a fatal outcome 
[6].
The CFR for the outbreak described in this report was calculated in 2 different ways. If all 
26 confirmed and probable cases were included, the CFR was 58%. However, inclusion of 
probable and retrospectively confirmed case patients in this calculation had considerable 
potential for bias, owing to the incomplete nature of retrospective investigations—fatal cases 
occurring prior to the outbreak’s detection were not able to be confirmed, and not all cases 
were able to be found. Therefore, we also calculated the CFR among confirmed case patients 
in whom MVD was confirmed only after the detection of the outbreak (ie, only case patients 
[4 of 9] with acute clinic disease), and we arrived at a CFR of 44%. However, this second 
estimate of CFR also has potential for bias because nearly all of these patients (8 of 9) 
received prompt care in isolation facilities, which may improve a patient’s chances for 
survival. However, the ascertainment of case patients identified during acute infection was 
complete, in that we were able to follow the clinical course of these patients from the time of 
diagnosis to discharge or death.
Regardless of which CFR calculation method is used, the case patients in the 2012 Uganda 
MVD outbreak had a much lower CFR, and there were fewer cases than in the 2 previous 
large-scale MVD outbreaks occurring in Africa—154 persons (CFR, 83%) during the 1998–
2000 outbreak in Durba-Watsa, Democratic Republic of Congo [6], and 252 persons (CFR, 
90%) during the 2005 outbreak in Uige, Angola (both calculated by including confirmed and 
probable case patients). The reasons for the large differences in CFR are not clear. Among 
extrinsic factors that could explain patient outcomes, both the Uige and Watsa outbreaks 
occurred in areas with histories of civil unrest, which led to a reduction in the overall health 
of the population and fewer resources for patient care at the affected hospitals. Access to 
adequate health care could potentially contribute to worse survival rates. However, it is also 
possible that recalculating the CFRs for these 2 outbreaks and including only confirmed 
cases with acute infection may also demonstrate a reduced CFR.

The relative virulence of the virus strains is another potential explanation for differences in 
CFR. The genome sequences that were described in the 2012 MVD outbreak (Ibanda-423 
2012 and Kabale-422 2012) were most closely related to those of strains that were found in 
bats in Uganda and 2 previous single cases in humans (Leiden 2008, 98% homology; and 
Musoke 1980, 94% homology) [25], so it is difficult to draw conclusions about the relative 
virulence of these strains in humans, compared with the virulence of the less closely related 
strains that caused the Uige outbreak (Ang 1382 2005, 93% homology) and the Durba 
outbreak (07DRC99 1999, 92% homology).
Although the difference was not statistically significant, it is noteworthy that the CFR of 
case patients admitted to an isolation ward (33%) was less than half the CFR of patients who 
were sick prior to the institution of isolation wards (71%). This could be due to the imperfect 
nature of retrospective case finding, in which recall bias may occur: interviewees may be 
more likely to remember the persons who became sick and died than to remember the 
persons who became sick and recovered [27]. Furthermore, we have no way to confirm that 
the probable cases were indeed a part of the outbreak, beyond the presence of epidemiologic 
links to confirmed cases; some of these cases may have died from unrelated causes, although 
the timing and exposures fit the criteria for MVD transmission. Regardless, the relatively 
low CFR of case patients treated in facilities with isolation precautions can hopefully be 
used to encourage the community to embrace these facilities as places for quality care of 
patients, rather than places for the community to fear [18].
In addition to the differing CFRs when comparing the 2012 Uganda case patients to the Uige 
and Watsa case patients, we also found differences in symptoms reported. While anorexia 
(92%) was nearly universally reported by 2012 Uganda confirmed and probable case 
patients, 66% and 77% of Uige and Watsa case patients, respectively, reported anorexia [6, 
15]. The 2012 Uganda case patients were similar to Watsa case patients with respect to the 
proportion reporting fever (96% and 93%, respectively), vomiting (76% and 76%), and 
hiccups (36% and 40%), whereas 85% of Uige case patients reported fever, 34% reported 
vomiting, and 5% had hiccups. The presence of hiccups was associated with being a case 
patient in the 2012 Uganda outbreak and was associated with fatal outcome in the Watsa 
outbreak. The 2012 Uganda case patients, however, had greater similarity to Uige case 
patients with respect to the proportion reporting diarrhea (44% and 46%, respectively) and 
any kind of hemorrhage (50% and 51%), whereas 57% of Watsa case patients reported 
diarrhea and 69% reported any hemorrhage. Melena was also more frequent in Watsa case 
patients (55%) than in case patients from the 2012 Uganda (0%) and Uige (17%) outbreaks. 
Limitations exist in attempting to compare frequencies of symptoms across outbreaks, 
because the data collection instruments and times at which symptoms were assessed may 
differ. However, the clinical picture portrayed by these 3 outbreaks shows a variety of 
nonspecific symptoms that can be present in case patients, further underlining the need for a 
broad case definition and laboratory confirmation of MVD cases during ongoing outbreaks.
Risk factors associated with being a confirmed or probable case patient were activities that 
put a person in close contact with other sick persons, such as participating in a funeral or 
having direct contact with another confirmed, probable, or suspected case patient prior to 
illness onset. This association was also found with Uige case patients [15] and is supported

by molecular evidence that, in this outbreak, a single strain of Marburg virus was transmitted 
through several generations of case patients. The importance of halting chains of 
transmission through institution of isolation precautions for all currently ill case patients and 
through active surveillance of all potentially exposed case contacts cannot be overstated. 
Following the institution of these public health measures, the outbreak was successfully and 
rapidly contained only 14 days after its initial detection.
In addition to MVD, Uganda has experience with several previous EVD outbreaks and cases 
[2, 14, 28] and has a well-developed infrastructure for responding to these outbreaks quickly. 
Scientific, logistic, and psychosocial support systems rapidly fell into place, leading to a 
successful effort despite the challenging multidistrict nature of this outbreak response. It was 
somewhat surprising in the retrospective investigation to find that case patients were 
identified with dates of onset tracing back to July 2012, meaning that the outbreak had gone 
undetected for >2 months, at a time when there was an EVD outbreak response occurring 
<200 km to the north, in Kibaale District [29] (Shoemaker, unpublished data). Furthermore, 
following the 2007 MVD outbreak in Ibanda, a district hospital had received specific 
training on viral hemorrhagic fever detection, control, and reporting in an attempt to improve 
disease detection. Clearly, identification of suspected MVD patients can be difficult, 
especially when the initial clinical manifestation mimics other common febrile illnesses and 
when hemorrhage and death is not universally observed.
Since 2011, a permanent laboratory capable of safely identifying patients infected with the 
region’s endemic hemorrhagic fever viruses (Ebola, Bundibugyo, Sudan, Marburg, Crimean- 
Congo hemorrhagic fever, and Rift Valley fever viruses) has been functional in Uganda. This 
is a joint effort through the UVRI and the CDC’s Viral Special Pathogens Branch, and it has 
contributed greatly to the ability to rapidly detect and confirm viral hemorrhagic fever 
outbreaks. During the MVD outbreak response described in this report, specimens from 
districts all over the country were sent to the CDC/UVRI laboratory for detection of agents 
responsible for viral hemorrhagic fever, including 2 specimens from individuals in Luwero 
District who were confirmed as having acute infection with Sudan ebolavirus [30], thus 
identifying the country’s third filovirus outbreak within 5 months. The 2012 Luwero 
outbreak was very small, with only 6 cases, and may have not been detected if there were a 
lower level of awareness of viral hemorrhagic fevers in general or if it had been more 
difficult to pursue diagnostic testing. Alternatively, the Luwero outbreak might have 
continued, with additional persons becoming ill and dying. Clearly, having laboratory 
capacity present in Uganda contributed to the early detection and response and to the rapid 
containment of these epidemics.
In conclusion, the 2012 Marburg virus outbreak in Uganda occurred over multiple districts 
but was traced back to Ibanda District. The origin of the outbreak could not be determined, 
although contact with R. aegyptiacus fruit bats or other infected wildlife at least 3 months 
prior to the outbreak’s detection was suspected. The CFR (58%) was lower than observed in 
previous MVD outbreaks in Africa. Rapid response, including initiation of contact-tracing 
activities, as soon as the outbreak was detected quickly brought the outbreak to a close.
