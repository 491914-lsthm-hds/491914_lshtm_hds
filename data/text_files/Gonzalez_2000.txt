ABSTRACT – With the natural history of the ﬁlovirus family seemingly unknown, ﬁlovirus ecology
in its natural environment remains a rudimentary ﬁeld of research. In order to investigate the
maintenance cycle of ﬁlovirus in Central Africa, a study was conducted within the rain forest of the
Central African Republic. The epidemiological study determines the frequency and distribution of
ﬁlovirus seroprevalence in a selected human population. Using an ELISA, serum samples from Pygmy
and non-Pygmy populations were tested for Ebola-Zaire virus and Marburg (MBG) virus antibody.
Filovirus antibody reacting sera were found in all zones investigated, and in all populations studied
(Ebola virus IgG 5.3%; Marburg virus IgG 2.4%). Pygmies appeared to have a signiﬁcantly higher
seroprevalence (P < 0.03) against Ebola-Zaire virus (7.02%) than non-Pygmies (4.2%). MBG virus or
related unknown ﬁlovirus strains also seem to be present in the western part of Central Africa. MBG
virus antibodies were present in different Pygmy groups (ranging from 0.7 to 5.6%, mean 2.05%) and
in several non-Pygmy populations (ranging from 0.0 to 3.9%, mean 3.4%) without an overall
signiﬁcant difference between the two groups (P = 0.14). The potentialities of nonpathogenic ﬁlovirus
strains circulating in the Central African Republic are discussed. © 2000 Éditions scientiﬁques et

1. Introduction
Since the discovery of the ﬁloviruses more than three
decades ago, their natural maintenance cycle remains
poorly deﬁned. Ebola (EBO) virus epidemics occurred in
Sudan in 1976, 1979 and 1995, in the Democratic Repub-
lic of the Congo (DRC, former Zaire) in 1976 and 1995 [1,
2], and in Gabon in 1994 to 1996 [3]. These countries
shared the same history of human migration and contem-
porary lifestyle with their neighboring country, the Central
African Republic (CAR). Up until now CAR has been
spared, but it is exposed to EBO virus emergence: Nzara,
the village and cotton factory where the ﬁrst Sudanese
EBO outbreak occurred, lies 150 km from the CAR border,
in the same savanna-forest mosaic zone that covers one
third of CAR [4]. Less than 150 km south of the Oubangui
River, which is the natural border between northern DRC
and CAR, are the villages of Yambuku and Tandala, where
the ﬁrst Zairian EBO infections took place [1, 5]. Both
villages are part of the large phytogeographical zone of the
Congolese rain forest that extensively covers the southern
part of CAR. Cultural and environmental similarities,
along with the proximity of previous EBO virus manifesta-
tions, favored the choice of CAR as a study site for ﬁlovirus
ecology. Another factor of the choice was the similarity of
CAR’s ecological domain with that of Uganda, which was
the country of origin of the monkeys exported to Europe in
1967 and the source of the ﬁrst Marburg (MBG) virus
outbreak and of the virus’ isolation [6]. It is clear that EBO

virus is present in CAR: as early as 1979, ﬁlovirus serologi-
cal markers were detected by immunoﬂuorescence anti-
body test and radioimmunoassay in the human population
of CAR [7-10]. In the 1980s, several research programs on
ﬁlovirus epidemiology were carried out in a collaborative
effort between the Institut Pasteur, Bangui, the Centers for
Disease
Control,
the
United
States
Army
Medical
Research Institute for Infectious Diseases, in Fort Detrick
and the Organisation de Coordination pour la lutte contre
les grandes endémies en Afrique Centrale, Yaoundé [10-
12].
In order to investigate the potential of active circulation
of ﬁlovirus in CAR, study sites and study populations were
identiﬁed in the Lobaye district, where high ﬁlovirus sero-
prevalence was previously detected [9, 12]. A three-phase
strategy was then established for 1) determining the
human population at risk of ﬁlovirus infection, 2) identify-
ing the potential risks factors associated with subsistence
activities such as hunting and gathering products from the
forest, and 3) identifying potential reservoir hosts of the
virus in nonprimates, rodents, bats and their ectoparasites.
Here we report a ﬁrst phase of an ongoing research pro-
gram for ﬁlovirus ecology in CAR, and present our ﬁndings
on an ELISA serosurvey principally of the Lobaye district’s
human populations as well as other pilot studies.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Study area
A mixture of preforest grassland and Congolese rain
forest covers the Lobaye district (ﬁgure 1). It is a primary
semi-deciduous, dense rain forest, which was long ago
transformed by man, and is now partly exploited by man
(logging, farming in clearings) and damaged along the
roads and logging trails. The Pygmy camps (Sangoumbe,
Sakoungbou and Mogboto) and non-Pygmy villages
(Gouga village) we studied are located in a remote forest
area (3°38 N, 18°03 E) 120 km south of Bangui, near the
Oubangui River and south of one of its major tributaries,
the Lobaye River. The Gouga villages are located about
two km from the Oubangui River and the Congo’s (Braz-
zaville) border.
The sera were collected in November 1995 at the
beginning of the dry season, which lasts about four
months.
In order to compare similar human populations and
environments to that of Lobaye, four series of serum
samples were also collected and tested. Sera were
obtained from Belemboke (3°12 N, 16°15 E) in December
1992 and November 1994, and from Nola (3°52 N 16°08
E) in December 1995 – both located in the Dzanga-
Sangha district, 400 km southwest of Bangui. The two
locations are secondary forest areas degraded by agricul-
tural activities. The other set of sera was collected in
October 1996, in a non-Pygmy population from Bangas-
sou (4°41 N, 22°48 E, Mbomou district), located 500 km
east of Bangui. Bangassou belongs to the forested savanna,
with forest galleries at the edge of the rain forest.
2.2. Study population
Residents of the study regions are for the most part
either farmers belonging to Bantu, Banda, or Oubanguian
language groups, or hunter-gatherers (Pygmies) called

BaAka group (or Aka). This ethnic group distribution
extends across the border of CAR into the northern part of
the Congo and partially into southeastern Cameroon [13].
In the Lobaye district, three groups of Pygmy Aka camps
(Sangoumbe, Sakoungbou and Mogboto) and a village
group (Gouga village) were investigated. Pygmy camps
are seasonal (three to six months) but each campsite can
be occupied for an interval throughout the year. Each
primary camp is composed of three to ﬁve secondary
camps units, each unit consisting of three to ﬁve primary
families from the same lineage, living in huts made of
leaves and lianas. Sangoumbe is located in a forest clear-
ing, 3 km north of Gouga. Sakoungbou’s camps are along
a logging trail, near the Lobaye River. Mogboto is 10 km
west of Sakoungbou in a forest clearing. Despite increas-
ing contact with the villagers living in the forest, most of
the Pygmies from that area have preserved a characteristic
seminomadic lifestyle based on hunting and gathering rain
forest natural resources. Villagers belong to Mbati tribe
(Bantu-speaking) and the remainder to the Mbanza and
Ngbundu tribes (Banda-speaking). Less than one kilometer
away, the Gouga village is a typical village of the Central
African forest: 34 primary families (384 individuals) living
in mud huts covered with woven palm tree leaves. Dwell-
ings are located on both sides of a narrow dirt road on the
shaded rain forest. They practice subsistence farming
(manioc, banana, coffee, yam), hunting (monkey, duiker,
antelope) and limited trapping (rodent, hedgehog) and
ﬁshing.
In Belemboke and Nola zones, a sedentary Pygmy
population living nearby in a missionary compound
seemed to have shifted from hunter-gatherers to subsis-
tence farmers. In the region of Bangassou, only the non-
Pygmy population was sampled.
2.3. Blood collection
A 10-cm3 blood specimen was obtained using vacu-
tainer (Becton Dickinson, France) from each volunteer as
previously described [9]. Blood was centrifuged on site
and sera kept in cryovials in a liquid nitrogen tank. An
interview form was completed which documented indi-
vidual demographic data (name, estimated age, sex, par-
ents, residence, ethnic group), occupation and means of
subsistence.
2.4. Filovirus antigen preparation
ELISA antigens were prepared at the Institute für Virolo-
gie, in Marburg. Virus strains and the techniques were
those in use at the Institute für Virologie and described in
detail elsewhere [14, 15]. Brieﬂy, EBO-Zaire virus (May-
inga strain) and MBG virus (Musoke strain) were grown in
E6-Vero cells. Centrifugation and ﬁltration (200-kDa ﬁlter)
cleared supernatant from infected cell culture. Virus was
then concentrated by precipitation and sucrose/tartrate
gradient ultracentrifugation. The concentrated virus was
then inactivated by B-propiolactone. The ﬁnal product
was sonicated and used as positive antigen after dilution in
carbonate buffer for coating microplates. The control anti-
gen, uninfected E6-Vero cell supernatant, was prepared
following
an
identical
procedure
(centrifugation,
B-propiolactone inactivation, and sonication).
2.5. ELISA
Tests were performed at the Institut Pasteur of Bangui
using a direct ELISA test for immunoglobulin G (IgG)
detection as described by Ksiazek [16]. Brieﬂy: polysty-
rene microplaques were used (Immulon II, Dynatech
Laboratories, Alexandria, VA USA) and directly coated at
4 °C overnight with a suspension of the EBO antigen and
the control antigen. Sera were diluted 1:100 in 5% skim
milk in 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline with 0.5%
Tween-20 and subsequently through 1:6 400 in fourfold
dilution in microplates. Each sample was tested against
EBO antigen and control antigen. Speciﬁc IgG binding
was revealed by an antihuman immunoglobulin G
(Kirkegaard and Perry, Gaithersburg, MD) conjugated to
horseradish peroxydase. After adding a chromogenic sub-
strate, the optical density was measured at 450 nm using a
spectrophotometer (LP 2100, SanoﬁDiagnostics Pasteur).
Differential optical density (DOD) for each dilution was
calculated by subtracting the optical density (OD)
obtained with the control antigen from the OD of the EBO
antigen. The cutoff value was deﬁned by using a mean OD
+ 2 SD from known negative control sera. Any DOD
greater than 0.300 was regarded as positive. Serum speci-
mens were considered positive if their titer was ≥1:400
and the sum of the OD of all four dilutions was greater
than 1.000.
3. Results
Serological evidence of EBO virus and MBG virus
circulation was found in all zones investigated: 5.3%
(71/1331) of the population were seropositive for EBO
virus IgG antibodies, while only 2.4% (33/1340) were
seroreactive with MBG virus antigen.
In the Lobaye district, EBO and MBG virus reacting
antibodies were detected in each village and camp inves-
tigated (tables I and II). Although the sample size was not
always sufficient to obtain statistical signiﬁcance, some
trends were still observed. The Aka Pygmy population
including the three camps of Sakoungbou, Sangoumbe
and Mogboto consistently showed higher antibody preva-
lence against both EBO-Zaire (13.2%) and MBG (5.2%)
viruses than the non-Pygmy villagers (respectively, 4.0 and
0.0%). EBO virus antibody prevalence observed among
Pygmy females was higher (15.3%) than that of males
(10.9%) but not statistically signiﬁcant (Chi2, P = 0.15).
However, among Pygmies, EBO virus antibody preva-
lence was signiﬁcantly higher among the 21–30 age group
(P < 0.05) (data not shown). MBG virus antibodies were
found exclusively in the Pygmy population (5.2%). Among
the Pygmies, males were more likely to present a higher
rate of MBG antibody prevalence (7.5%) than females
(3.1%) (P < 0.05).
In the other investigated areas (table III), a higher EBO
virus antibody seroprevalence was also observed in the
Pygmy population than in villagers. Pygmies living in
Belemboke presented an increasing EBO virus antibody
prevalence between 1992 and 1994 (P = 0.003) without
clinical manifestation. In the non-Pygmy population living

in Nola and Bangassou, EBO virus seroprevalence was
similar to that of the same population group of the Lobaye
district. MBG antibody prevalence was higher in farmers
than in the Pygmy group of Belemboke.
In this study, only 4/1331 serum samples had both EBO
virus and MBG virus antibody (table IV), suggesting dual
infections. As a control, 68 coded serum samples (14 EBO
virus reactive and 54 nonreactive) were sent to the Centers
for Disease Control (Special Pathogens Branch, Dr T.
Ksiazek), Atlanta to be expertised and tested against EBO-
Zaire, EBO-Sudan, and EBO-Ivory Coast antigens. All
results were conﬁrmed, and only one serum sample was
found double reacting EBO-Zaire-positive (1:1,600) and
EBO-Sudan (1:400)-positive.
4. Discussion
Seroepidemiological studies help to understand the
transmission cycle. A determining factor lies in the tech-
niques used. The limitations of indirect immunoﬂuores-
cent assay were recognized early [17]. ELISA technique
for the detection of IgG EBO virus antibodies has recently
been recommended by several authors [18, 19] and com-
bined a better speciﬁcity and a high sensibility. In this
study, we used EBO-Zaire as antigen in the ELISA tech-
nique and we have observed a very low rate of cross-
reactivity with the three other subtypes of EBO virus and
only 0.3% of reactive sera showed a dual positivity EBO-
MBG. These ﬁndings suggest that EBO virus circulating in
CAR is more likely a Central African EBO-Zaire-like virus.
From previous EBO virus clinical and serological sur-
veys done in Central Africa [8–11] studying the geographi-
cal distribution of EBO virus infection [14, 15, 17], and the
present data, it appears that EBO viruses circulated in
Africa between the 1 500 isohyet north and south of the
equator, which corresponds to the limits of the rain forest/
forested savanna domain. The EBO virus strain from the
Taï forest of Ivory Coast has been found in the same

ecological zone as its most closely genetically related
EBO-Zaire strain [20]. The limited divergence between
the two strains and their association within the same
forested zone may suggest a common origin, since the
Ivorian forested massif was at one time part of the Congo-
lese rain forest from which it became separated during the
last glaciation (16 000 years ago). Because of the phyto-
geographical composition of CAR and its relatedness to
the emergence zones of EBO virus, this country is believed
to host a seat of ﬁlovirus circulation.
Our present study done in human populations living in
forested areas of CAR has bought to the fore two main
observations: 1/ active circulation of ﬁlovirus without
apparent clinical manifestations; 2/ potential association
of ﬁlovirus infection and a speciﬁc lifestyle.
This study performed in forested areas showed that the
Pygmy population of CAR living in camps appeared to be
more at risk to ﬁlovirus infection than sedentary villagers.
However no trend of seropositivity was observed for Pyg-
mies living in camps in the deep forest compared to those
living near a road, where local trade with villagers resulted
in reduced contact with the forest for subsistence activi-
ties. Pygmies from Lobaye and Belemboke appeared to
have the same seroprevalence over recent years. Each of
the non-Pygmy sample population involved in subsistence
farming and trading activities presented the same EBO
virus antibody prevalence. One ﬁnding was the presence
of signiﬁcant MBG virus antibodies in the population of
CAR. In accordance with previous ﬁndings [9, 14, 15], this
unusually high antibody prevalence suggests a circulation
of MBG virus or MBG-like virus within that part of Central
Africa situated in the same ecological zone as the sus-
pected Ugandese origin of the MBG virus. MBG virus
seroprevalence was signiﬁcantly higher (P > 0.05) for the
Pygmy population of the Lobaye than for the one of
Belemboke, a situation which remains unexplained.
The forest origin of the potential reservoir of EBO virus
is supported by serosurvey among human populations,
although epidemic outbreak occurred in the forest-
savanna ecotone in Sudan, DRC and Gabon. If the risk is
present in two different ecosystems, research for detection
of the reservoir must be not limited to rain forest but
investigations need to be extended to forest-savanna eco-
tone.
Clinical cases of EBO virus infection are rare and could
suggest that risk of human infection from the host reservoir
is low, but serologic results indicate that exposure to EBO
virus is not uncommon and didn’t always result in obvious
human disease. Previous observations and studies using
different laboratory techniques suggested that unknown
ﬁloviruses with variable pathogenicity might exist in dif-
ferent
parts
of
the
world [14].
The
hypothesis
of
Monath [21] is that pathogenic strains have independent
transmission cycles involving host species rarely in con-
tact with humans, or they emerge from nonpathogenic
strains by mutational events. Humans could select virulent
strain from the reservoir. On the basis of rates of EBO virus
antibody seroprevalence observed, the hypothesis of the
circulation of nonpathogenic EBO virus strains seems to
be the more favorable one. It is possible that the ﬁloviruses
represent a diverse complex of nonvirulent enzootic
strains and virulent variants, which emerge from the
enzootic cycle. Moreover, the existence of EBO-Reston
and EBO-Ivory Coast viruses isolated from primates and
highly pathogenic for chimpanzees but nonfatal for man
(although the number of human infections is small), sug-
gests that other ﬁloviruses with suspected lower human
pathogenicity exist and infect primates in the natural envi-
ronment [14, 20]. During a ﬁve-year project on clinical
epidemiological survey in CAR, neither clinical syn-
dromes nor outbreaks mimicking either EBO virus or MBG
virus infection where recorded. Moreover during a four-
year serosurvey of a cohort of 200 persons conducted in
CAR, in fourteen instances seroconversions against EBO-
Zaire virus without clinical manifestation were detected
(J.P. Gonzalez and E.D. Johnson, unpublished data).
Our observations suggest that populations of CAR have
been in contact with EBO virus and MBG virus previously.
EBO virus distribution in Central Africa appears limited to
a distinct ecosystem geographically associated within the
rain forest belt extending to forest-savanna ecotone. This
observation will help to select animal collection sites to
elucidate the EBO virus natural reservoir(s). Finally, epi-
demics seem to be related more to human behavior, which
increases risk of contact with the reservoir than to the
emergence of a highly pathogenic strain. However EBO
virus strains circulate in the rain forest and, with man’s
intrusion, could led to infection. In a rare event, which has
not been yet discovered, a highly pathogenic strain can
strike
and
cause
subsequent
outbreak.
Differences
between communities living in forest regions, such as
habitat, human activities, and agricultural practices, may
modify the risk of infection.
MBG virus antibodies were present in different Pygmy
groups with an antibody seroprevalence ranging from 0.7
to 5.6% (mean 2.05%), but also in several non-Pygmy
populations (0.0 to 3.9%, mean 3.4%). No signiﬁcant
difference was recorded between the two groups (P =
0.14). MBG virus or related unknown ﬁlovirus strains also
seem to be present in the western part of Central Africa and

selvatic cycle than EBO virus with respect to its apparent
extension from Central to East Africa and a very low
seroprevalence is encountered [9, 11].
