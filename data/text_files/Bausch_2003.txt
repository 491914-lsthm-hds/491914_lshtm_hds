We conducted two antibody surveys to assess risk fac-
tors for Marburg hemorrhagic fever in an area of confirmed
Marburg virus transmission in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo. Questionnaires were administered and serum
samples tested for Marburg-specific antibodies by enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay. Fifteen (2%) of 912 partici-
pants in a general village cross-sectional  antibody survey
were positive for Marburg immunoglobulin G antibody.
Thirteen (87%) of these 15 were men who worked in the
local gold mines. Working as a miner (odds ratio [OR] 13.9,
95% confidence interval [CI] 3.1 to 62.1) and receiving
injections (OR 7.4, 95% CI 1.6 to 33.2) were associated
with a positive antibody result. All 103 participants in a tar-
geted antibody survey of healthcare workers were antibody
negative. Primary transmission of Marburg virus to humans
likely occurred via exposure to a still unidentified reservoir
in the local mines. Secondary transmission appears to be
less common with Marburg virus than with Ebola virus, the
other known filovirus.
M
arburg hemorrhagic fever (MHF) is a severe illness
caused by Marburg virus, a member of the
Filoviridae family. MHF was first described in 1967 dur-
ing outbreaks in Germany and the former Yugoslavia that
were linked to monkeys imported from Uganda (1–3).
Since then, only a few sporadic cases in East Africa and
southern Africa and one laboratory infection have been
identified (4–7). Serosurveys for Marburg antibodies in the
general population generally have shown prevalences of
<2%, indicating it to be a rare and highly lethal disease
(8–25).
The largest outbreak of MHF recorded to date began in
late 1998 in northeastern Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC) (26,27). Although the remoteness of the area
and the civil war in eastern DRC delayed access and eval-
uation, in May 1999 a team of international investigators
identified 73 cases (8 laboratory-confirmed and 65 sus-
pected cases retrospectively identified) (28). Follow-up
surveillance subsequently identified >150 cases through
December 2000. 
The natural reservoir for Marburg virus remains
unknown, although it is presumed to be of zoonotic origin.
Primary transmission of the virus from the natural reser-
voir appears to occur only in sub-Saharan Africa and is
sometimes followed by secondary person-to-person trans-
mission in both community and nosocomial settings
(4–6,29). Because of the disease’s rarity and lethality, risk
factors for transmission of Marburg virus have not been
extensively investigated. We therefore performed two anti-
body surveys in the wake of the 1998–99 outbreak in DRC
to explore risk factors for Marburg virus exposure and
transmission. One antibody survey was a cross-sectional
study of the general village populations; the other was a
focused investigation of healthcare workers (HCWs).

Methods
Area of Study
The studies we describe were performed as an adjunct
to the investigation of an outbreak of MHF in May 1999.
The epicenter of the outbreak was the village of Durba in
the Haut-Uélé District, Oriental Province, in northeastern
DRC, an isolated region approximately 200 km from the
borders of Uganda and Sudan (Figure). Although no offi-
cial population count for Durba is available, unofficial
estimates are approximately 25,000. Watsa, a larger town
of approximately 60,000 and the administrative seat of the
zone, lies 14 km away. Although the Yogo ethnic group
predominates, the population of Durba/Watsa is quite het-
erogeneous, as many people have migrated to the area to
work in the local gold mines. Most are Catholic. The area
has had intermittent armed conflict since the beginning of
the Congolese civil war in 1996, a situation that has
severely limited travel and economic growth. 
The livelihood of most of the population in the
Durba/Watsa area is associated with gold mining, conduc-
ted almost exclusively by young men and most often with-
out professional training or equipment. Some older men,
women, and children are involved in the extraction of gold
from ore and its sale. Subsistence farming and hunting are
also common. Although various mines exist in the area,
most mining appears to take place in the Goroumbwa mine
a few kilometers from the village of Durba. In addition,
some miners dive in local rivers in search of gold. The
existence of a hemorrhagic illness in the region appeared
to be common knowledge and was labeled “Durba hemor-
rhagic syndrome” or “Durba syndrome” by the villagers,
who often associated it with working in the mines. 
Because of the remoteness of the region and the war,
supplies are severely limited in all the health facilities in
the region. The major facility in Durba is a small rudimen-
tary government health center staffed by a few nurses. In
Watsa, there is a larger government hospital, a hospital
affiliated with the mining company, and two government
health centers. In addition, at least 14 small private health
centers operate collectively in Durba and Watsa.
Study Population
Two surveys were undertaken. The first was a cross-
sectional survey on a convenience sample of the general
population of Durba township. It was performed by estab-
lishing a post in the center of the village. With the aid of
local HCWs and a village loud-speaker system, residents
of sequential “quartiers” of the village were requested to
come for evaluation over a 3-day period. Persons <15
years of age were excluded. The second survey focused on
HCWs at all health centers in Durba and Watsa. All HCWs
were surveyed at their place of employment. 
Questionnaire
The rationale for conducting the study was explained to
all participants, and verbal consent was obtained.
Questionnaires were pretested on local villagers not
included in the final study. For the general population, a 2-
page questionnaire was administered. Supervisors at the
local mining company were consulted about appropriate
questions regarding exposures in the mines. Persons were
first evaluated by local village HCWs, who determined
their ability to speak and understand French. If deemed
able to do so, the person was then interviewed by either a
local HCW or a French-speaking member of the interna-
tional investigative team. For those persons who did not
understand French, the questionnaire was administered by
a local HCW
in the appropriate local language.
Participants were asked about their entry into and activities
within the mines, exposures to persons presumably sick
with Durba syndrome (defined as a severe illness with high
fever and bleeding from the nose, mouth, and/or anus) in
the hospital and at home, and exposures to various animals
thought to possibly transmit Marburg virus (rodents, bats,
and monkeys). Participants were given a small bag of
peanuts as a token of appreciation for their cooperation.
For the study of HCWs, a 1-page questionnaire was
administered; HCWs were asked about exposure to per-
sons with suspected Durba syndrome at work and at home,
as well as any history of a compatible illness in the HCWs
themselves. HCWs were also asked if they had ever
entered the mines. Interviews were conducted in French. 
Phlebotomy and Serologic Testing
After administration of the questionnaire, 5 mL of
blood was obtained and stored out of the sunlight. At the

end of the day, the serum and clot were separated, labeled,
and stored in liquid nitrogen. Aliquots were sent on dry ice
for analysis at both the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia, USA, and the
National Institute for Communicable Diseases in
Johannesburg, South Africa.
Testing for Marburg-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) M
and IgG antibodies by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) was conducted with a technique analogous
to that reported for detecting antibody to Ebola virus,
except for the substitution of an antigen made from the
Musoke strain of Marburg virus (30,31). The cut-off value
for a positive ELISA result was set to 3 standard devia-
tions from the mean control-adjusted optical density (OD)
of 410 nm found on a panel of normal serum samples. This
value generally corresponds to an OD of approximately
0.1 at a dilution of 1:100 for the IgM assay, and 0.2 at
1:400 for the IgG assay, which generally has a higher
background. Positive and negative controls were included
with each run and consisted of serum from African
patients with and without a laboratory-confirmed history
of MHF. Because the rarity of MHF has precluded rigor-
ous field testing of the ELISA for Marburg antibody, all
ELISA-positive serum samples were also examined by the
immunofluorescent antibody assay (IFA), as previously
described (32). The cut-off titer for a positive IFA result
was 1:50. Serum samples were considered positive only if
positive results were obtained by both ELISA and IFA.
Study participants were directed to seek the serologic
results (free of charge) 1 month after testing from the
nurse in charge of the local health center. The nurse was
provided the results along with details on how to interpret
antibody status.
Data Analysis
Questionnaires were created by using EpiInfo version
6.04 (CDC, Atlanta, GA). Data were initially recorded on
the questionnaires by hand, then entered into EpiInfo 6.04,
and finally imported into SPSS version 10.0 statistical
software (SPSS, Chicago, IL) for further analysis. The chi-
square test, Fisher exact test, and Student t test with
Levene’s test for equality of variances were employed,
where appropriate. Data found to be non-normally distrib-
uted were normalized by a log 10 transformation before
statistical analysis. Statistical tests were two-sided, and
significance was set at p < 0.05. Variables with signifi-
cance values of p < 0.1 in the univariate analysis were
examined in a multivariate model using forward stepwise
maximum likelihood logistic regression. 
Results
General Population
A total of 912 participants were surveyed. Another
seven persons were initially enrolled but did not stay to
complete their questionnaires or to have a blood sample
drawn. No further information is available regarding these
seven or their reasons for withdrawal. Demographic data
are presented in Table 1. Since the gold deposits in Durba
attract young male miners from the surrounding region,
most participants were men (65%), and 347 (38%) listed
their occupation as miner, although only 281 (81%) of
these 347 were currently working in the mines. Virtually
all (99%) of the miners were male. Marburg-specific IgG
antibodies were found in 15 (2%) of the 912 study partici-
pants. All were IgM antibody–negative. Thirteen (87%) of
the 15 IgG antibody–positive participants were male min-
ers. The other two were women who had never entered into
the mines and whose profession was listed as “other”
(most likely housewives). 
All 13 of the antibody-positive miners were currently
working: 10 (77%) at Goroumbwa, 2 (15%) at another
mine in Durba, and 1 (8%) at an unspecified site. None
reported river-diving for gold. Compared with those who
were antibody-negative, antibody-positive miners tended
to have worked fewer years at their present mine site but to
have spent more time in the mines, although the differ-
ences were not statistically significant (Table 2). Antibody-
positive miners were significantly younger than their anti-
body-negative counterparts (Table 1). This finding perhaps
reflects the longer exposure time in the mines of younger
miners (age <30 years) relative to older miners (mean +

week 17.7 + 1.2 vs. 13.7 + 1.3, respectively, p = 0.006;

We examined associations between antibody to
Marburg virus and various practices while working in the
mines, as well as exposures related to sick persons in the
home, healthcare services, and animals. In a univariate
analysis, significant positive associations were found
with having touched the corpse of someone who died
from Durba syndrome, having had Durba syndrome one-
self, and having received injections in the past year (Table
3). Touching the blood, feces, or urine of someone with
Durba syndrome was of borderline statistical signifi-
cance. Consumption of rodents was associated with a bor-
derline significant protective effect, which was probably
a spurious association. Of the four antibody-positive sur-
vey participants who said they had had Durba syndrome
themselves, three dated the illness to the 5 months imme-
diately before the study. The fourth, although uncertain,
dated his illness to September 1998, 9 months before the
investigation. 
Receiving an injection as part of medical treatment was
common in Durba: 505 (56%) of 907 of the participants in
our cross-sectional village survey reported receiving an
injection in the previous year, including 13 (87%) of the 15
antibody-positive participants (11 miners and both female
nonminers). Overall, however, receiving injections was
significantly more common among nonminers than miners
(62 [368/596] vs. 47 [162/348], respectively, OR 1.9, 95%
CI 1.4 to 2.4, p < 0.001) and among women than men
(71% [221/312] vs. 49% [305/626], respectively, OR 2.6,
95% CI 1.9 to 3.4, p < 0.001). 
In a multivariate model, the only variables that
remained significantly associated with a positive Marburg
antibody result were being a miner (OR 13.8, 95% CI 3.1
to 62.1) and having received injections (OR 7.4, 95% CI
1.6 to 33.2). Having previously had Durba syndrome was
not added to the model, as it was not an independent risk
factor for acquiring MHF. The associations between
Marburg antibody, mining, and receiving injections
remained essentially unaltered when men were looked at
independently. The number of antibody-positive women
(two) was too small to permit meaningful statistical analy-
sis. However, both positive women were among the rela-
tively few survey participants with extensive secondary
contact in the household. Both reported having someone in
the household sick with Durba syndrome, having contact
with their body fluids, and participating in their burial,
although only one of the two women reported direct con-
tact with the corpse. In contrast, 4 (31%) of the 13 anti-
body-positive male miners reported any type of household
exposure.
Healthcare Workers
One hundred three HCWs were enrolled from 15 differ-
ent health centers, including 73 (71%) nurses, 13 (13%)
clerical or administrative staff, 10 (10%) midwives, 5 (5%)
laboratory workers, and 2 (2%) doctors. These figures are
thought to represent virtually all of the active HCWs in the
two villages except those practicing traditional medicine.
HCWs had a mean of 9 years (range 0–42) of experience.
All were negative for both Marburg IgM and IgG antibod-
ies, despite the fact that 67 (65%) reported caring for a
patient with Durba syndrome, and 5 (5%) reported having
had Durba syndrome themselves. Types of patient contact
included administering injections (38%); cleaning up
blood, vomitus, urine, or feces (28%); washing bed clothes
(7%); washing corpses (6%); and receiving a needlestick
injury (2%). 
Discussion
Despite conclusive evidence of circulation of Marburg
virus in the Durba/Watsa area in the months and years pre-
ceding our antibody surveys, we found few persons with
serologic evidence of previous infection (26,27). This like-
ly reflects a combination of the rarity of MHF and the high
case-fatality ratio (83%) associated with the disease in
Durba/Watsa, leaving few survivors for study.
Most previous observations on risk factors for MHF
have been of an anecdotal nature. Despite the small num-
ber of antibody-positive survey participants found in
Durba, we were able to systematically identify and quan-
tify several risk factors for MHF. The preponderance of
antibody in male miners without obvious evidence for per-
son-to-person transmission suggests that the local mines
are a site of primary infection with Marburg virus, most
likely through exposure to the primary zoonotic reservoir.
Various previous findings support the conclusion of an
association between MHF and exposure in mines and
caves, including the following: 1) most cases of MHF
identified in Durba/Watsa through December 2000
occurred in miners (J.J. Muyembe-Tamfum et al., unpub.
data); 2) molecular epidemiologic data demonstrate the

circulation of numerous distinct genotypes of Marburg
virus in Durba/Watsa, consistent with multiple parallel pri-
mary introductions rather than a single one amplified by
secondary spread (R. Swanepoel et al., unpub. data); and
3) previous cases of MHF have been associated with entry
into caves (5,6).
As expected, close contact with case-patients with
MHF or corpses were risk factors for secondary transmis-
sion of Marburg virus. Although injection with contami-
nated syringes has been previously shown to be associated
with filovirus transmission, the retrospective nature of our
study makes it impossible to discern whether the use of
Marburg virus-contaminated syringes resulted in virus
transmission in Durba/Watsa or whether patients sick with
MHF, usually a severe disease, were simply more likely to
seek and receive medical care, including injections
(33,34). That the general profile of the antibody-positive
persons who received injections (male miners) contrasted
with that of the general population (female, nonminer)
suggests that the latter explanation may be more likely.  
Although at least seven HCW infections have been con-
firmed in Durba/Watsa since 1998, we found no antibody-
positive HCWs, despite what would appear to be frequent
high-risk exposures (35, J.J. Muyembe-Tamfum et al.,
unpub. data). The high case-fatality ratio may again
explain the absence of antibody-positive HCWs, although
historical review does not suggest the existence of previ-
ous large nosocomial epidemics in Durba/Watsa (D.
Bausch et al., unpub. data). Sound barrier nursing practices
on behalf of local HCWs may have helped prevent noso-
comial transmission but, given the severely limited avail-
ability of protective material in the area, this is unlikely to
be the sole explanation. 
The low prevalence of Marburg antibody found in
Durba/Watsa, despite what would be considered signifi-
cant risk factors for person-to-person transmission, sug-

dScarification is the practice of intentionally scarring the skin with sharp instruments. It may be done for aesthetic reasons or because of a belief that it has medicinal or 
spiritual value. 
eMany participants reported the meat was smoked or cured at the time of purchase, so potential exposure to viable virus may have been limited. 
gests that secondary transmission of Marburg virus may be
relatively infrequent compared with transmission of the
other known member of the filovirus family, Ebola virus.
In contrast to Ebola hemorrhagic fever (33,34), no large
nosocomially amplified outbreaks of MHF have been
noted. Only six secondary infections (five nosocomial and
one sexually transmitted) were noted of the 32 cases
reported during the original MHF outbreak in 1967 in
Europe, despite the fact that the etiologic agent was
unknown at the time of the outbreak and thus appropriate
barrier nursing measures were unlikely to have been rap-
idly implemented (1–3,36–38). Smith et al. reported that
1 of 207 close contacts of a case-patient with MHF con-
tracted the virus (5). Neither MHF nor antibody devel-
oped in a nurse in Durba who suffered a needlestick injury
while caring for a case-patient with laboratory-confirmed
and subsequently fatal MHF during the 1999 outbreak in
DRC; however, the needle and IV line may have been
flushed before the accident. Finally, immunohistochemi-
cal studies of skin biopsy specimens from patients with
fatal MHF generally show that Marburg virus antigen is
more sparsely distributed relative to Ebola antigen in fatal
cases of Ebola hemorrhagic fever, which suggests that
there may be less cutaneous shedding of Marburg virus
and thus lower person-to-person communicability in
MHF (S. Zaki et al., pers. commun.).
Our study had several limitations. As participants were
not randomly selected, disproportionate participation from
specific subpopulations could have skewed our results.
Selective participation could have occurred because of fear
of stigmatization or selective migrations of persons into or
out of Durba/Watsa. Social stigmas could have also result-
ed in recall bias. The small number of Marburg
antibody–positive participants limits our statistical power
to identify all possible risk factors for MHF. Although
ELISA testing for Marburg antibody has not undergone
rigorous field testing, we believe that our conservative cri-
terion of positive results on both ELISA and IFA for a par-
ticipant to be considered Marburg antibody–positive lends
credence to our conclusions. The precise duration of anti-
body persistence after Marburg infection is unknown for
both tests. If reversion to antibody-negative status appears
after a relatively short time, some previously infected per-
sons may have escaped detection. However, most of the
aforementioned limitations would likely result in false-
negative results, with the ultimate effect of underestimat-
ing the magnitude of any recognized associations. 
In defining risk factors for primary transmission of
Marburg virus in Durba/Watsa, our study helps orient the
hunt for the reservoir for the filoviruses. If primary infec-
tion to humans is indeed occurring in the mines around
Durba/Watsa, future investigations of the reservoir for
Marburg virus should focus on fauna present in such habi-
tats. Bats, rodents, arthropods, and plant life within
cave/mine habitats would be the prime suspects. Samples
taken from small mammals captured in and around mines
in Durba are being analyzed for possible Marburg virus
infection (R. Swanepoel, pers. commun.). Only a combina-
tion of the use of epidemiologic and epizootiologic inves-
tigations along with direct observations made during
outbreaks is likely to shed light on the still-cryptic natural
history of the filoviruses.
