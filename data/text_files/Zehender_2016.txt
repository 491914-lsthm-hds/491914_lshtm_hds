The aim of this study was to investigate the origin and geographical dispersion of Marburg virus, the ﬁrst member
of the Filoviridae family to be discovered. Seventy-three complete genome sequences of Marburg virus isolated
from animals and humans were retrieved from public databases and analysed using a Bayesian
phylogeographical framework. The phylogenetic tree of the Marburg virus data set showed two signiﬁcant evo-
lutionary lineages: Ravn virus (RAVV) and Marburg virus (MARV). MARV divided into two main clades; clade A
included isolates from Uganda (ﬁve from the European epidemic in 1967), Kenya (1980) and Angola (from the
epidemic of 2004–2005); clade B included most of the isolates obtained during the 1999–2000 epidemic in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and a group of Ugandan isolates obtained in 2007–2009. The estimated
mean evolutionary rate of the whole genome was 3.3 × 10−4 substitutions/site/year (credibility interval 2.0–4.8).
The MARV strain had a mean root time of the most recent common ancestor of 177.9 years ago (YA) (95% highest
posterior density 87–284), thus indicating that it probably originated in the mid-XIX century, whereas the RAVV
strain had a later origin dating back to a mean 33.8 YA. The most probable location of the MARV ancestor was
Uganda (state posterior probability, spp = 0.41), whereas that of the RAVV ancestor was Kenya (spp = 0.71).
There were signiﬁcant migration rates from Uganda to the DRC (Bayes Factor, BF = 42.0) and in the opposite di-
rection (BF = 5.7). Our data suggest that Uganda may have been the cradle of Marburg virus in Africa.

1. Introduction
Marburg virus was the ﬁrst discovered member of the Filoviridae
(Siegert et al., 1968), a family of enveloped, non-segmented, negative-
stranded RNA viruses with a characteristic ﬁlamentous structure
(Rougeron et al., 2015). The Marburgvirus genus is one of three known
Filoviridae genera, and accounts for a single viral species, Marburg
marburgvirus, that includes the two distinct and quite divergent strains
of Marburg virus (MARV) and Ravn virus (RAVV) (Kuhn et al., 2010).
These tow strains are the causative agents of Marburg virus disease
(MVD), a highly lethal condition that clinically resembles Ebola virus
disease (EVD) (Brauburger et al., 2012), and has so far been reported
in Uganda, the north-eastern area of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC), Kenya, Zimbabwe and northern Angola. These areas are
separated by distances of sometimes even thousands of kilometres,
and lie in ecologically diverse regions that include rain forests and arid
woodlands (Brauburger et al., 2012; Peterson et al., 2006). Unlike EVD,
MVD has been more frequently observed as sporadic cases or small ep-
idemics (Adjemian et al., 2011; Conrad et al., 1978; Johnson et al., 1996;
Smith et al., 1982), with the signiﬁcant exceptions of two large-scale ep-
idemics: one in Durba, the DRC, in 1998–99 (Bausch et al., 2006; Kuhn,
2008), and the other in Uige, Angola, in 2004–2005 (Feldmann, 2006;
Towner et al., 2006). Moreover, at least eight of the 13 MVD cases pub-
lished so far may have been epidemiologically related to human entry
into caves or mines (Adjemian et al., 2011; Amman et al., 2014;
Brauburger et al., 2012).
The isolation of MARV from specimens of the common Egyptian fruit
bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) captured in Gabon in 2007 (Towner et al.,
2007), and healthy infected R. aegyptiacus bats caught in the Kitaka
mine in Uganda (Towner et al., 2009) and the Goroumbwa mine near
Durba in the DRC, makes it likely that this species is a natural reservoir
of the disease. Moreover, other fruit and insectivorous bat species have
also been found to be positive for MARV DNA or antibodies in different
parts of Africa (Pourrut et al., 2009; Swanepoel et al., 2007). Interesting-
ly, both Marburg virus lineages can co-circulate in humans and bats in
the same area (Towner et al., 2009), and closely similar isolates can be
found in widely separated locations (Towner et al., 2009). The origin,

host range and path of dispersion of Marburg virus have not yet been
deﬁned, and the same is true of the ecological factors that inﬂuence
their spread and transmission to humans.
The aim of this study was to investigate the origin and mechanisms
of dispersion of Marburg virus within Africa using a Bayesian
phylogeographical approach.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Sequence data sets
This analysis is based on a total of 73 complete genome sequences of
Marburg virus isolated in various African countries and retrieved from
public databases (GenBank at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov./genbank/).
The sequences were selected using the following inclusion criteria:
i) they had to have previously published in peer-reviewed journals; ii)
their non-recombinant subtype assignment had to be certain; iii) the
city/state of origin and year of sampling had to be known and clearly
established in the original publication.
The sampling dates ranged from 1967 to 2012, and the sampling lo-
cations were Uganda (UG, n = 22), Zimbabwe (ZW, n = 1), Kenya (KE,
n = 11), Angola (AO, n = 9), and the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
DRC (CD, n = 30). More information regarding the used dataset are
shown in Supplementary Table 1. The 1967 Marburg epidemic se-
quences were considered Ugandan.
All of the sequences were aligned using ClustalX software
(Thompson et al., 1994) and then manually edited using Bioedit soft-
ware v. 7.2.5 (freely available at http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/bioedit/
bioedit.html). Only the coding regions of the whole genome were
considered.
2.2. Likelihood mapping
In order to obtain an overall impression of the phylogenetic signals
in the analysed sequences, we made a likelihood-mapping analysis of
10,000 random quartets generated using TreePuzzle (Schmidt et al.,
2002). A likelihood map consists of an equilateral triangle: each dot
within the triangle represents the likelihoods of the three possible
unrooted trees for a set of four sequences (a quartet) randomly selected
from the data set. The dots close to the corners or at the sides respective-
ly represent tree-like (fully resolved phylogenies in which one tree is
clearly better than the others) or network-like phylogenetic signals
(three regions in which it is not possible to decide between two topol-
ogies); the central area of the map represents a star-like signal (the re-
gion in which the star tree is the optimal tree).
2.3. Root-to-tip regression analysis
In order to investigate the temporal structure and “clock-likeness” of
the Marburg virus data set, we made a regression analysis of the root-to-
tip genetic distance against sampling years using Path-O-Gen
(Rambaut, 2000), and a maximum-likelihood tree without a molecular
clock assumption (Guindon and Gascuel, 2003).
2.4. Phylogenetic reconstruction
The evolutionary model that best ﬁtted the data was selected using
an information criterion implemented in JmodelTest v. 2.1.7 (Posada,
2008) (freely available at http://darwin.uvigo.es/software/jmodeltest.
html), which selected the general time reversible + gamma distribution
(GTR + Γ) model of nucleotide substitution.
Phylogeny was initially analysed using the selected model and
MrBayes v. 3.7 program (Huelsenbeck and Ronquist, 2001). A Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) search was made for 10 × 106 generations
until reaching convergence using tree sampling every 100th generation
with a burn-in fraction of 50%. Statistical support for speciﬁc clades was
obtained by calculating the posterior probability (pp) of each monophy-
letic clade, and a posterior consensus tree was generated after a 50%
burn-in.
The evolutionary rates were estimated using a Bayesian MCMC
method implemented in BEAST 1.8.0 (Drummond et al., 2012) under
strict and relaxed clock conditions, and an uncorrelated log normal
rate distribution model. Four demographic models of population
growth were compared as coalescent priors: constant size, exponential
growth, logistic growth, and a piecewise-constant Bayesian skyline plot
(BSP) (Drummond et al., 2005).
The chains were run for 100 million generations until reaching con-
vergence, and sampled every 10,000 steps. Convergence was assessed
on the basis of an effective sampling size (ESS) of N200 after a 10%
burn-in using Tracer software v. 1.5 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/
tracer/). The analysis was made after partitioning the entire coding se-
quences into codon positions. Uncertainty in the estimates was indicat-
ed by the 95% highest posterior density (95% HPD) intervals, and the
best ﬁtting models were selected using a Bayes factor (BF) with margin-
al likelihoods implemented in BEAST. In accordance with (Kass and
Raftery, 1995), the strength of the evidence against H0 was evaluated
as follows: 2lnBF b2 no evidence; 2–6 weak evidence; 6–10 strong evi-
dence, and N10 very strong evidence. A negative 2lnBF indicates evi-
dence in favour of H0. Only values of ≥6 were considered signiﬁcant.
The trees were summarised as a maximum clade credibility (MCC)
tree (the tree with the largest product of posterior clade probabilities)
after a 10% burn-in using the Tree Annotator program included in the
BEAST package. The time of the most recent common ancestor
(tMRCA) estimates were expressed as mean values and 95% HPD
years before the most recent sampling dates, corresponding to 2012
for the analysed dataset. The ﬁnal trees were visualised and manipulat-
ed using FigTree v.1.4.0 (available at http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/
ﬁgtree/).
2.5. Bayesian phylogeography
The geographical analysis was made using the continuous time Mar-
kov chain (CTMC) process over discrete sampling locations implement-
ed in BEAST, and the Bayesian Stochastic Search Variable Selection
(BSSVS) model, which allows diffusion rates to be zero with a positive
prior probability (Lemey et al., 2009). Comparison of the posterior and
prior probabilities that the individual rates were zero provided a formal
BF for testing the signiﬁcance of the linkage between locations. Rates
with a BF of N3 were considered well supported and formed the migra-
tion pathway.
The MCC tree was selected from the posterior tree distribution after
a 10% burn-in using the TreeAnnotator program, version 1.8.0, and the
ﬁnal tree was visualised using FigTree, version 1.4. The signiﬁcant mi-
gration rates were analysed and visualised using SPREAD (Bielejec et
al., 2011), which is available at http://www.kuleuven.be/aidslab/
phylogeography/SPREAD.html.
The 73 isolates were assigned to ﬁve distinct geographical groups
corresponding to the sampled locations (Uganda, Zimbabwe, Kenya,
Angola, and the DRC). In order to provide a spatial projection, the migra-
tion routes indicated by the tree were visualised using Google Earth
(http://earth.google.com).
2.6. Viral gene ﬂow analysis
The MacClade program, version 4 (Sinauer Associates, Sunderland,
MA) was used to test viral gene out/in using a modiﬁed version of the
Slatkin and Maddison test (Slatkin and Maddison, 1989). A one-charac-
ter data matrix was obtained from the original data set by assigning a
one-letter code indicating geographical origin to each taxon in the
tree. The putative origin of each ancestral sequence (i.e. internal node)
in the tree was then inferred by ﬁnding the most parsimonious recon-
struction (MPR) of the ancestral character. No ACCTRAN or DELTRAN

resolving options were used because there were no uncertainties in the
tree. The ﬁnal tree length (i.e. the number of observed viral gene ﬂow
events in the genealogy) can be computed and compared with the
tree-length distribution of 10,000 trees obtained by random joining-
splitting (null distribution) whose observed genealogies are signiﬁcant-
ly shorter than random trees, thus indicating the presence of subdivided
populations with a restricted gene ﬂow. Viral gene ﬂow (migration) was
traced using MacClade state changes and stasis software, which counts
the number of changes in a tree for each pair-wise character state.
Gene ﬂow was also calculated for a null distribution in order to assess
whether the gene ﬂow events observed in the actual tree were signiﬁ-
cantly higher (N95%) or lower (b95%) than the values in the null distri-
bution at a p level of 0.05.
The isolates were divided into ﬁve distinct groups based on their
sampling locations (Uganda, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Angola and the DRC).
2.7. Selection pressure analysis
The non-synonymous/synonymous rate ratio dN/dS (ω) was esti-
mated using the maximum likelihood (ML) approach under a global
single-ratio model implemented in the HyPhy program (Kosakovsky
Pond and Frost, 2005). In particular, the global model (which assumes
a single selective pressure for all branches) was compared with the
local model (which allows selective pressure to change along every
branch) using the likelihood ratio test (LRT). Site-speciﬁc positive or
negative selection was estimated using three different algorithms: sin-
gle likelihood ancestor counting (SLAC) derived from the Suzuki-
Gojobori approach (Suzuki and Gojobori, 1999); ﬁxed-effects likelihood
(FEL), which ﬁts an ω ratio to every site and uses the likelihood ratio to
test whether dN ≠dS; and random effect likelihood (REL), a variant of
the Nielsen-Yang approach (Yang and Nielsen, 2000) that assumes the
existence of a discrete distribution of rates across sites and allows
both dS and dN to vary independently site-by-site, together with a
mixed effects model of evolution (MEME) in order to detect episodic di-
versifying selection. The three methods are described in more detail
elsewhere (Kosakovsky Pond and Frost, 2005) (Murrell et al., 2012).
Finally, in order to investigate whether the sampled sequences had
been subject to selective pressure at population level (i.e. along internal

likelihoods of the three possible unrooted trees for each quartet randomly selected from
the data set: the dots near the corners or sides respectively represent tree-like (fully
resolved phylogenies in which one tree is clearly better than the others) or network-like
phylogenetic signals (three regions in which it is not possible to decide between two
topologies). The central area of the map represents a star-like signal (the region in
which the star tree is the optimal tree). The numbers indicate the percentage of dots in
the centre of the triangle.

branches), an internal ﬁxed effects likelihood (IFEL) method (Pond et
al., 2006) was also used.
The PRIME model was used to take into account the biochemical
properties of the amino acids on the basis of their chemical composition,
polarity, volume, isoelectric point, and hydropathy (Conant et al., 2007).
In order to select the sites under selective pressure, we assumed a p-
value of ≤0.1 or a posterior probability of ≥0.9. The analyses were made
using the Web-based Datamonkey interface (http://www.datamonkey.
org/) (Pond et al., 2005).
3. Results
3.1. Likelihood mapping
The entire data set of 73 complete MARV genomes underwent
likelihood mapping. The evaluation of 10,000 randomly chosen
quartets showed that 0.5% fell into the central area of the likeli-
hood map and 99% were at the corners of the triangle, thus sug-
gesting that the alignment contained sufﬁcient phylogenetic
information (Fig. 1).
3.2. Phylogenetic analysis
Bayesian analysis of the entire Marburg virus data set showed two
highly signiﬁcant evolutionary lineages (pp = 1) corresponding to
MARV and RAVV (highlighted in Fig. 2). The MARV lineage included
two main clades, the ﬁrst of which (A) branched into three highly signif-
icant subclades (pp from 1 to 0.99): A1 consisted of 10 Ugandan isolates
(ﬁve obtained during the ﬁrst documented Marburg epidemic in 1967,
and ﬁve sporadic cases from 2008–2012) and a single isolate from the
2000 epidemic in the DRC; A2 consisted of a group of Kenyan isolates ob-
tained in 1980; and A3 consisted of isolates obtained during the 2004–
2005 epidemic in Angola. The second major clade (B), which had an
outgroup consisting of a single 1975 isolate from Zimbabwe, branched
into two subclades: B1 (pp = 1) included the majority of the isolates ob-
tained during the 1999–2000 epidemic in the DRC; and B2 consisted of a
number of Ugandan isolates obtained in 2007–2009. Interestingly, the
DRC isolates in B1 formed at least three highly signiﬁcant monophyletic
groups (pp = 1). The RAVV isolates segregated into two highly signiﬁcant
subclades (pp = 1): RAVV1 included Kenyan strains isolated in 1987, and
RAVV2 a number of Ugandan isolates from 2007–2009 and a single se-
quence obtained in the DRC in 1999. The analysis of genetic distances

nodes (AO = Angola, ZW = Zimbabwe, CD = Democratic Republic of the Congo, UG = Uganda, KE = Kenya). The numbers on the internal nodes indicate signiﬁcant posterior
probabilities (pp N0.8), and the scale at the bottom of the tree represents calendar years. The main geographical clades are highlighted. The histograms on the left show the state
posterior probabilities (spp) of the different locations of the roots of the MARV and RAVV lineages.

showed a median nucleotide difference of 16.9 substitutions/100 sites
(range 16.7–17.0) between the MARV and RAVV lineages, whereas the
median difference between the MARV subclades (A1-3 and B1-2) was
6.0 substitutions/100 sites (range 0.9–6.5).
Root-to-tip regression analysis showed that the root of the MARV
strain was between clade A and B, and the correlation coefﬁcient of
0.83 suggests a signiﬁcant relationship between genetic divergence
and time.

3.3. Evolutionary rate estimates and dated tree reconstruction
Comparison of the different coalescent models using the BF test on
the entire dataset showed that the model best ﬁtting the data was a co-
alescent prior BSP (2lnBF constant vs BSP = 54.4, and exponential vs
BSP = 1693.8) under a log-normal relaxed clock (2lnBF strict vs relaxed
clock = 23.8). The estimated mean evolutionary rate was 3.3 × 10−4
subs/site/year (95%HPD 2.0–4.8 × 10−4). Analysis of the MARV strain
using the tree root estimated by the Path O Gen program conﬁrmed
the value obtained using the entire dataset (evolutionary rate
3.0 × 10−4; 95% HPD 1.8–4.2 × 10−4). The analysis was also made
after partitioning the entire coding sequences into codon positions: on
average, the rate in codons 1 + 2 was six times lower than that in
codon 3 (0.388 vs 2.22).
Fig. 3 shows the phylogeographical maximum clade credibility
(MCC) tree, the topology of which is identical to that described above,
with high posterior probability values for the nodes corresponding to
the main clades and subclades.
The tMRCAs of the internal nodes were estimated on the basis of the
mean evolutionary rate values and intervals (Table 1). The root tMRCA
was 353.8 (between 150 and 635) years ago (YA). The MARV strain
had an estimated mean root tMRCA of 177.9 YA (95%HPD 87–284 YA),
which indicates that particularly clade A originated in the 19th century,
whereas clade B (including the majority of the DRC isolates) originated
between the 1920s and 1970s (on average, in 1952). The mean tMRCA
of subclade A1 (including the sequences of the ﬁrst European outbreak)
dates back to the 1950s (between 1937 and 1962), whereas those of
subclades A2 (Kenya) and A3 (Angola) preceded the beginning of
their respective epidemics by only a few years (1–6 years). The 1999–
2000 DRC isolates in subclade B1 coalesced in 1987 (credibility interval
1981–1993), and the Ugandan isolates in subclade B2 originated in
1999 (95%HPD 9.32–18.19 YA). Finally, the RAVV strain had a mean
tMRCA of 33.8 YA (95%HPD 27–42 YA) and therefore dated back to
1978.
3.4. Phylogeographical analysis
The location of the tree root was between Kenya (state posterior
probability, spp = 0.35) and Uganda (spp = 0.29); this region had a
0.6 combined spp of being the original location of circulating viruses.
As shown in Fig. 3, the most probable origin of the MARV strain was
Uganda (spp = 0.45 vs 0.28 for the second most probable location),
and that of RAVV was Kenya (spp = 0.71 vs 0.18 for the second most
probable location).
Table 1 shows the most probable locations and the associated state
posterior probabilities of the various clades and subclades. The MARV
clade A had an MRCA that was most probably located in Uganda
(spp = 0.41), whereas that of clade B was located in the DRC (spp =
0.5). The MRCA locations of the subclades always corresponded with
the sampling locations.
The signiﬁcance of the spatio-temporal linkage between the differ-
ent geographical locations was calculated using a BF test, assuming
that the posterior and prior probabilities of the individual rates were
zero. There was a mean of 5.2 non-zero rates (95%HPD = 4–7) out of
10, and the rates with a BF of N3 were between Uganda and the DRC
(BF = 3569), between Kenya and Uganda (BF = 3.4), and between Zim-
babwe and the DRC (BF = 3.5). The asymmetrical substitution model
for discrete traits, which allows for different rates of migration between
locations, showed that the signiﬁcant pathways were from Uganda to
the DRC (BF = 42.0) and in the opposite direction (BF = 5.7), and
from Kenya to Uganda (BF = 6.8). Fig. 4 shows the migration routes
and estimated times.
The gene ﬂows (migrations) between the different geographical
areas were also investigated using a modiﬁed version of the Slatkin
and Maddison method. The null hypothesis of panmixia was rejected
for all of the countries in the bubblegram by the randomisation test
(p = 0.0001). The gene ﬂows were highly asymmetrical, with the
viral infections expanding from Uganda to various countries: almost
42.9% were from Uganda to the DRC, whereas those from Uganda to
Zimbabwe, Kenya and Angola accounted for respectively 14.3%, 28.6%
and 14.3% of the migrations (Fig. 5).
3.5. Selection pressure analysis
The ML estimate of the dN / dS ratio (ω) gave a mean value of 0.126
(95% CI: 0.116–0.136), with signiﬁcant differences between the lineages
(the LRT from the global and local model indicated a 2Δ likelihood of
132, p = 0.0176). The analysis of site-by-site selection pressure showed
that 24 sites were under positive selection (supported by at least two
methods at a signiﬁcance level of 90%; Table 2), 14 of which were signif-
icantly supported by the IFEL method (which detects sites selected
along the internal branches) and mainly corresponded to subclade-spe-
ciﬁc substitutions (Fig. 6). The majority of codons under positive pres-
sure were in the L protein (14/2231 amino acids, 0.62%) and
glycoprotein (5/681 amino acids, 0.73%). There were also codons
under positive pressure in the NP (2/695 amino acids, 0.28%), and
VP35, VP40 and VP30 proteins, each of which had a single residue
under positive selection (0.3–0.35% of residues).
Finally, the PRIME method was used to estimate the changes in bio-
chemical properties induced by the evolutionary process. As shown in
Table 2, four residues had modiﬁed properties (three in the polymerase
and one in the VP30 protein).
4. Discussion
Marburg virus is still classiﬁed as a single viral species despite the
considerable genetic differences between the MARV and RAVV strains
(16% at nucleotide level in this study). Our phylogenetic analysis
showed that the MARV isolates grouped into two main clades (A and
B) that had a mean genetic difference of 6% of nucleotides, and branched
into a number of subclades that largely corresponded to the geograph-
ical sources of the isolates. The isolates of the initial European outbreak
in 1967 (a virus probably originating in Uganda) formed a signiﬁcant

dan human and bat isolates sampled between 2008 and 2012, and a se-
quence obtained in Durba (DRC, 1999). Other isolates obtained in Kenya
in 1987, and during the 2004–2005 outbreak in Angola, formed separate
subclades (A2 and A3). Clade B included the large majority of MARV iso-
lates from the 1999–2000 epidemic in Durba (B1), and Ugandan isolates

obtained in 2007–2009 grouped together in the closely related but sep-
arate subclade B2.
The main aim of this study was to assess the spatio-temporal phy-
logeny of Marburg virus. The genetic heterogeneity of the MARV and
RAVV strains made it difﬁcult to obtain a single estimate of the substitu-
tion rate. The global substitution rate for the entire viral genome
(3.3 × 10−4; CI 2.0–4.8 × 10−4 subs/site/year) was conﬁrmed by the in-
dependent analysis of the MARV strain alone, which gave a high corre-
lation coefﬁcient in the regression analysis of the genetic distance
against the sampling years. This value is similar to that previously pub-
lished by (Carroll et al., 2013) and is included within his conﬁdence
interval.
Our Bayesian phylogeographical analysis assigned similar posterior
probabilities to Kenya and Uganda at the tree-root, with the combined
posterior probability of 0.6 indicating the origin of the viruses in this
area. The most probable location of the MARV lineage was Uganda
(spp = 0.41), and that of the RAVV lineage was Kenya (spp = 0.71).
The use of a different approach based on maximum parsimony indicat-
ed that Uganda was the most probable location of the tree root, and this
was supported by the highly signiﬁcant ﬂows from Uganda to all of the
other sites of Marburg virus infections.
The uncertainty of the root of the tree including both MARV and
RAVV was also conﬁrmed by the tMRCA estimates dating back to an av-
erage of 354 YA, but with a broad credibility interval (from 150 to
635 years) that has also been found by other authors (Carroll et al.,
2013). This suggests the absence of one or more steps in the reconstruc-
tion of the evolutionary history of the two viruses. More precise esti-
mates have been obtained for the tMRCAs of MARV (dating back to
about the mid-19th century) and RAVV, which did not emerge until
the 1970s.
Interestingly, the oldest MARV subclade (subclade A1), which in-
cludes the virus that caused the ﬁrst known outbreak in Europe in
1967, had an estimated tMRCA in the early 1950s, thus indicating the
existence of MARV in an enzootic cycle long before it was ﬁrst docu-
mented in humans.
On the basis of our phylogeographic reconstruction, Marburg virus
spread westward to an area of the DRC that is relatively close to the
Ugandan border, and southward, where it was identiﬁed in a cave in
Zimbabwe between the 1950s and the 1980s (Fig. 3). We estimated
that subclade B1 reached the DRC in the late 1980s and, in line with
this, a disease similar to Marburg hemorrhagic fever has been docu-
mented in the area of Durba at least since it was ﬁrst recognised in a
miner in 1987, and it is known that outbreaks occurred in the same
area in 1990, 1992, 1994 and 1997, before the large-scale epidemic of
1999–2000 (Bausch et al., 2006). The epidemic in the DRC was singular
insofar as it was caused by at least nine lineages, possibly due to multi-
ple spillovers from the animal reservoir (Bausch et al., 2006). The differ-
ent lineages circulating in the DRC did not become extinct, but re-
emerged in the Kitaka mine and Python Cave in Uganda seven years
after the DRC outbreak. These observations suggest that the strains in-
volved in the 1999–2000 epidemic were characterised by ecological/ep-
idemiological dynamics that were very different from those of all of the
other strains (in Kenya, Angola and the Gabon), which remained con-
ﬁned to a single outbreak and became extinct immediately afterwards.
The signiﬁcant bi-directional genetic ﬂow between Uganda and the
DRC found by our phylogeographical analysis suggests the possibility
of repeated exchanges of strains between these two areas.
These results indicate that new viral variants may emerge periodi-
cally in reservoir animals, and become predominant in different places
as a result of continuous viral evolution prevalently driven by genetic
drift. This is supported by our analysis of positive selection pressure,
which showed that only a minority of codons in the entire viral genome
were subject to signiﬁcant positive selection. The protein with the
highest percentage of positively selected amino acid sites (0.7%) was
the polymerase, followed by the glycoprotein (0.3%): however, the
rate of selected sites was always b1%, frequently episodic, and did not
cause any signiﬁcant and long-lasting changes at population level.
Only four sites showed a signiﬁcant change in the biochemical proper-
ties of the mutated amino acids.
In conclusion, Marburg viruses seem to have two different patterns
of viral dispersion. In the ﬁrst, a single viral variant arises a median of
four years before an outbreak, remains temporally and spatially con-
ﬁned to a speciﬁc episode, and apparently disappears immediately af-
terwards: this pattern includes the large-scale epidemic in Angola and
the two episodes in Kenya. The second is characterised by long-term
persistence and frequent re-circulation, as seen in the case of many
Ugandan and some DRC strains, which may have persisted for years
(from the early 1950s to 2012). The presence of all the major viral clades
in Python Cave and the Kitaka mine supports a central role of Uganda as
the cradle of the Marburg virus in Africa, although further studies of a
larger number of isolates are needed to support this hypothesis.
