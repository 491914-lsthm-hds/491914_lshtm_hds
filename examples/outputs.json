        "Gear_1975.txt": "**Summary of the Article:**\nThe article describes an outbreak of Marburg virus disease in Johannesburg in 1975, following a previous outbreak in 1967 in West Germany and Yugoslavia. The primary case involved a young Australian man who had traveled through Rhodesia and subsequently died in Johannesburg Hospital. Two secondary cases occurred: one in his traveling companion and another in a nurse who cared for him. The article details the clinical presentation, management, and virological studies of the three patients, comparing these findings with the previous outbreak. It also discusses the epidemiological and clinical aspects of the disease, including the incubation period, symptoms, and outcomes.\n\n**Extraction of Epidemiological Parameters:**\nTo extract the requested epidemiological parameters, I will focus on the sections of the article that discuss the methods, results, and discussion, as these typically contain relevant data.\n\n1. **Incubation Period:**\n   - The article mentions that the incubation period in the 1967 outbreak was estimated to be three to nine days. For the 1975 outbreak, it suggests that the first patient likely contracted the disease during his travels in Rhodesia, and the third case (a nurse) had an incubation period of about seven or eight days.\n   - **Extracted Information:** 3-9 days (from previous outbreak), 7-8 days (from 1975 outbreak)\n\n2. **Generation Time:**\n   - **Not explicitly reported.**\n\n3. **Time Symptom to Outcome (Death):**\n   - The first patient died on the seventh day from hemorrhage resulting from disseminated intravascular coagulation and hepatic failure.\n   - **Extracted Information:** 7 days\n\n4. **Time Symptom to Outcome (Other):**\n   - The two secondary cases recovered after an acute phase lasting about seven days.\n   - **Extracted Information:** 7 days\n\n5. **Time in Care:**\n   - The first patient was admitted to the hospital and died seven days later. The secondary cases were also in care for the duration of their illness, but specific durations are not detailed beyond the acute phase.\n   - **Extracted Information:** 7 days (for the primary case)\n\n6. **Time Symptom to Careseeking:**\n   - The first patient was admitted to the hospital after being ill for four days.\n   - **Extracted Information:** 4 days\n\n**CSV Output:**\n```xml\n<extracted_parameters>\nparameter_type, parameter_value, unit, parameter_value_type, uncertainty_interval_lower_bound,uncertainty_interval_upper_bound,uncertainty_type\nIncubation Period, 3-9, days, range, 3, 9, range\nIncubation Period, 7-8, days, range, 7, 8, range\nTime Symptom to Outcome (Death), 7, days, exact, , , \nTime Symptom to Outcome (Other), 7, days, exact, , , \nTime in Care, 7, days, exact, , , \nTime Symptom to Careseeking, 4, days, exact, , , \n</extracted_parameters>\n```\n\nThis output reflects the epidemiological parameters as reported in the article, focusing on the sections that typically contain such data.",
